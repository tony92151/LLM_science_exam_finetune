"Which of the following statements accurately describes the impact of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on the observed ""missing baryonic mass"" discrepancy in galaxy clusters?","The presence of a clustered thick disk-like component of dark matter in the Galaxy has been suggested by Sanchez-Salcedo (1997, 1999) and Kerins (1997).Kerins, E.

The observed distortions can be used to model the distribution of dark matter in the cluster. == Temperature and density == Clusters of galaxies are the most recent and most massive objects to have arisen in the hierarchical structure formation of the Universe and the study of clusters tells one about the way galaxies form and evolve. A 2021 article postulated that approximately 50% of all baryonic matter is outside dark matter haloes, filling the space between galaxies, and that this would explain the missing baryons not accounted for in the 2017 paper. == Current state == Currently, many groups have observed the intergalactic medium and circum-galactic medium to obtain more measurements and observations of baryons to support the leading observations. In cosmology, the missing baryon problem is an observed discrepancy between the amount of baryonic matter detected from shortly after the Big Bang and from more recent epochs.","MOND is a theory that reduces the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters by postulating the existence of a new form of matter called ""fuzzy dark matter.""",MOND is a theory that increases the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 20.,MOND is a theory that explains the missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters that was previously considered dark matter by demonstrating that the mass is in the form of neutrinos and axions.,MOND is a theory that reduces the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 2.,MOND is a theory that eliminates the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters by imposing a new mathematical formulation of gravity that does not require the existence of dark matter.,D,True,"MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) is a theory that proposes a modification to Newtonian gravity to explain the observed discrepancies in the motion of galaxies without the need for dark matter. It does not postulate the existence of a new form of matter like 'fuzzy dark matter' or explain the missing baryonic mass as neutrinos and axions. Therefore, options A, C, and E can be eliminated. The correct answer is likely option D, which states that MOND reduces the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 2. However, we need to be cautious as the background knowledge does not explicitly mention the specific impact of MOND on the missing baryonic mass discrepancy in galaxy clusters. Further research may be required to confirm the accuracy of option D."
Which of the following is an accurate definition of dynamic scaling in self-similar systems?,"Many of these systems evolve in a self-similar fashion in the sense that data obtained from the snapshot at any fixed time is similar to the respective data taken from the snapshot of any earlier or later time. Many other seemingly disparate systems which are found to exhibit dynamic scaling.

What is the significance of regularization in terms of renormalization problems in physics?,"Renormalization is distinct from regularization, another technique to control infinities by assuming the existence of new unknown physics at new scales. == Self-interactions in classical physics == thumbnail|upright=1.3|Figure 1. Regularization is the first step towards obtaining a completely finite and meaningful result; in quantum field theory it must be usually followed by a related, but independent technique called renormalization. Rather than the existence of unknown new physics, assuming the existence of particle interactions with other surrounding particles in the environment, renormalization offers an alternatively strategy to resolve infinities in such classical problems. ==Specific types== Specific types of regularization procedures include *Dimensional regularization *Pauli–Villars regularization *Lattice regularization *Zeta function regularization *Causal regularizationScharf, G.: Finite Quantum Electrodynamics: The Causal Approach, Springer 1995. In physics, especially quantum field theory, regularization is a method of modifying observables which have singularities in order to make them finite by the introduction of a suitable parameter called the regulator. Similar regularization arguments work in other renormalization problems.","Regularizing the mass-energy of an electron with a finite radius can theoretically simplify calculations involving infinities or singularities, thereby providing explanations that would otherwise be impossible to achieve.",Regularizing the mass-energy of an electron with an infinite radius allows for the breakdown of a theory that is valid under one set of conditions.

Which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between the dimensions of a diffracting object and the angular spacing of features in the diffraction pattern?,"Several qualitative observations can be made of diffraction in general: * The angular spacing of the features in the diffraction pattern is inversely proportional to the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. In other words: The smaller the diffracting object, the 'wider' the resulting diffraction pattern, and vice versa. * The diffraction angles are invariant under scaling; that is, they depend only on the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the diffracting object. The simplest descriptions of diffraction are those in which the situation can be reduced to a two-dimensional problem. * When the diffracting object has a periodic structure, for example in a diffraction grating, the features generally become sharper. ","The angular spacing of features in the diffraction pattern is indirectly proportional to the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. Therefore, if the diffracting object is smaller, the resulting diffraction pattern will be narrower.","The angular spacing of features in the diffraction pattern is directly proportional to the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. Therefore, if the diffracting object is smaller, the resulting diffraction pattern will be narrower.","The angular spacing of features in the diffraction pattern is independent of the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction.

"Which of the following statements accurately depicts the relationship between Gauss's law, electric flux, electric field, and symmetry in electric fields?","For a closed Gaussian surface, electric flux is given by: where * is the electric field, * is any closed surface, * is the total electric charge inside the surface , * is the electric constant (a universal constant, also called the ""permittivity of free space"") () This relation is known as Gauss' law for electric fields in its integral form and it is one of Maxwell's equations. Under these circumstances, Gauss's law modifies to \Phi_E = \frac{Q_\mathrm{free}}{\varepsilon} for the integral form, and abla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{free}}{\varepsilon} for the differential form. ==Interpretations== ===In terms of fields of force=== Gauss's theorem can be interpreted in terms of the lines of force of the field as follows: The flux through a closed surface is dependent upon both the magnitude and direction of the electric field lines penetrating the surface. See the article Gaussian surface for examples where these symmetries are exploited to compute electric fields. ===Differential form=== By the divergence theorem, Gauss's law can alternatively be written in the differential form: abla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} where is the divergence of the electric field, is the vacuum permittivity, \varepsilon_r is the relative permittivity, and is the volume charge density (charge per unit volume). ===Equivalence of integral and differential forms=== The integral and differential forms are mathematically equivalent, by the divergence theorem.

What is the term used in astrophysics to describe light-matter interactions resulting in energy shifts in the radiation field?,"While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as ""redshifts"" and ""blueshifts"", in astrophysics light-matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as ""reddening"" rather than ""redshifting"" which, as a term, is normally reserved for the effects discussed above. In physics, a redshift is an increase in the wavelength, and corresponding decrease in the frequency and photon energy, of electromagnetic radiation (such as light). The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and simultaneous increase in frequency and energy, is known as a negative redshift, or blueshift. For example, Doppler effect blueshifts () are associated with objects approaching (moving closer to) the observer with the light shifting to greater energies. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of the line of sight. ==Blueshift== The opposite of a redshift is a blueshift.

What is the role of axioms in a formal theory?,"A formal system is an abstract structure used for inferring theorems from axioms according to a set of rules. The explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with. A formal theory is an axiomatic system (usually formulated within model theory) that describes a set of sentences that is closed under logical implication. These rules, which are used for carrying out the inference of theorems from axioms, are the logical calculus of the formal system.

What did Fresnel predict and verify with regards to total internal reflections?,"For added confidence, Fresnel predicted and verified that four total internal reflections at 68°27' would give an accurate circular polarization if two of the reflections had water as the external medium while the other two had air, but not if the reflecting surfaces were all wet or all dry.Fresnel, 1866, pp.761,793–6; Whewell, 1857, p.359. Using old experimental data, he promptly confirmed that the equations correctly predicted the direction of polarization of the reflected beam when the incident beam was polarized at 45° to the plane of incidence, for light incident from air onto glass or water.Buchwald, 1989, pp.390–91; Fresnel, 1866, pp.646–8. In each case there were two solutions, and in each case he reported that the larger angle of incidence gave an accurate circular polarization (for an initial linear polarization at 45° to the plane of reflection). The verification involved * calculating the angle of incidence that would introduce a total phase difference of 90° between the s and p components, for various numbers of total internal reflections at that angle (generally there were two solutions), * subjecting light to that number of total internal reflections at that angle of incidence, with an initial linear polarization at 45° to the plane of incidence, and * checking that the final polarization was circular.Fresnel, 1866, pp.760–61,792–6; Whewell, 1857, p.359.

What is the relationship between the Wigner function and the density matrix operator?,"Most importantly, the Wigner quasi-probability distribution is the Wigner transform of the quantum density matrix, and, conversely, the density matrix is the Weyl transform of the Wigner function. :Note: the Wigner distribution function is abbreviated here as WD rather than WDF as used at Wigner distribution function A Modified Wigner distribution function is a variation of the Wigner distribution function (WD) with reduced or removed cross-terms. The original WD, the spectrogram, and the modified WDs all belong to the Cohen's class of bilinear time-frequency representations : :C_x(t, f)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}W_x(\theta, u) \Pi(t - \theta,f - u)\, d\theta\, d u \quad = [W_x\,\ast\,\Pi] (t,f) where \Pi \left(t, f\right) is Cohen's kernel function, which is often a low-pass function, and normally serves to mask out the interference in the original Wigner representation. == Mathematical definition == *Wigner distribution : W_x(t,f) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t+\tau/2) x^*(t-\tau/2) e^{-j2\pi\tau f} \, d\tau Cohen's kernel function : \Pi (t,f) = \delta_{(0,0)} (t,f) *Spectrogram :SP_x (t,f) = |ST_x (t,f)|^2 = ST_x (t,f)\,ST_x^* (t,f) where ST_x is the short-time Fourier transform of x.

What is one of the examples of the models proposed by cosmologists and theoretical physicists without the cosmological or Copernican principles that can be used to address specific issues in the Lambda-CDM model and distinguish between current models and other possible models?,"The current standard model of cosmology is the Lambda-CDM model, wherein the Universe is governed by general relativity, began with a Big Bang and today is a nearly-flat universe that consists of approximately 5% baryons, 27% cold dark matter, and 68% dark energy.See the Planck Collaboration's 2015 data release. The standard cosmological model is known as the Lambda-CDM model. ===Equations of motion=== Within the standard cosmological model, the equations of motion governing the universe as a whole are derived from general relativity with a small, positive cosmological constant. The effect on cosmology of the dark energy that these models describe is given by the dark energy's equation of state, which varies depending upon the theory. These proposals typically modify some of the main features of Lambda-CDM, but do not reject the Big Bang. ===Anisotropic universe=== Isotropicity – the idea that the universe looks the same in all directions – is one of the core assumptions that enters into the Friedmann equations. However, the final announcement (in April 1992) of COBE satellite data corrected the earlier contradiction of the Big Bang; the popularity of plasma cosmology has since fallen. == Alternatives and extensions to Lambda-CDM == The standard model of cosmology today, the Lambda-CDM model, has been extremely successful at providing a theoretical framework for structure formation, the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, and the accelerating expansion of the universe.","The Copernican principle, which proposes that Earth, the Solar System, and the Milky Way are not at the centre of the universe, but instead, the universe is expanding equally in all directions.

What is the Roche limit?,"In celestial mechanics, the Roche limit, also called Roche radius, is the distance from a celestial body within which a second celestial body, held together only by its own force of gravity, will disintegrate because the first body's tidal forces exceed the second body's self-gravitation. But note that, as defined above, the Roche limit refers to a body held together solely by the gravitational forces which cause otherwise unconnected particles to coalesce, thus forming the body in question. The Roche limit for a rigid spherical satellite is the distance, d, from the primary at which the gravitational force on a test mass at the surface of the object is exactly equal to the tidal force pulling the mass away from the object:see calculation in Frank H. Shu, The Physical Universe: an Introduction to Astronomy, p. 431, University Science Books (1982), . : d = R_M\left(2 \frac {\rho_M} {\rho_m} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} where R_M is the radius of the primary, \rho_M is the density of the primary, and \rho_m is the density of the satellite. The Roche limit is also usually calculated for the case of a circular orbit, although it is straightforward to modify the calculation to apply to the case (for example) of a body passing the primary on a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory. === Rigid satellites === The rigid-body Roche limit is a simplified calculation for a spherical satellite. Since, within the Roche limit, tidal forces overwhelm the gravitational forces that might otherwise hold the satellite together, no satellite can gravitationally coalesce out of smaller particles within that limit.",The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to rotate since the forces exerted by two massive bodies produce a torque on a third object.,The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to unite since differential force from a planet results in parts becoming attracted to one another.,The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause a planet to disintegrate since differential force from an object overcomes the planet's core.,The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to disintegrate since differential force from a planet overcomes the attraction of the parts between them.,"The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to break apart due to differential force from the planet overcoming the attraction of the parts of the object for one another, which depends on the object's density and composition, as well as the mass and size of the planet.",D,False,fail
What is Martin Heidegger's view on the relationship between time and human existence?,"===Time=== Heidegger believes that time finds its meaning in death, according to Michael Kelley.

"What is the ""ultraviolet catastrophe""?","The ultraviolet catastrophe, also called the Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe, was the prediction of late 19th century/early 20th century classical physics that an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium would emit an unbounded quantity of energy as wavelength decreased into the ultraviolet range.The term ""ultraviolet catastrophe"" was first used in 1911 by Paul Ehrenfest, but the concept originated with the 1900 statistical derivation of the Rayleigh–Jeans law. The ""ultraviolet catastrophe"" is the expression of the fact that the formula misbehaves at higher frequencies, i.e. B_{ u}(T) \to \infty as u \to \infty. Ultraviolet is a novelization of the science fiction film of the same name. Ultraviolet astronomy is the observation of electromagnetic radiation at ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 10 and 320 nanometres; shorter wavelengths--higher energy photons--are studied by X-ray astronomy and gamma- ray astronomy.

What is the most popular explanation for the shower-curtain effect?,"However, the shower-curtain effect persists when cold water is used, implying that this cannot be the only mechanism at work. ===Bernoulli effect hypothesis === The most popular explanation given for the shower-curtain effect is Bernoulli's principle. The shower-curtain effect in physics describes the phenomenon of a shower curtain being blown inward when a shower is running. If air is moving across the inside surface of the shower curtain, Bernoulli's principle says the air pressure there will drop. In a steady state the steam will be replaced by new steam delivered by the shower but in reality the water temperature will fluctuate and lead to times when the net steam production is negative. ===Air pressure=== Colder dense air outside and hot less dense air inside causes higher air pressure on the outside to force the shower curtain inwards to equalise the air pressure, this can be observed simply when the bathroom door is open allowing cold air into the bathroom. ==Solutions== Many shower curtains come with features to reduce the shower-curtain effect. By pushing the curtain in towards the shower, the (short range) vortex and Coandă effects become more significant. ",The pressure differential between the inside and outside of the shower,The decrease in velocity resulting in an increase in pressure,The movement of air across the outside surface of the shower curtain,The use of cold water,Bernoulli's principle,E,True,"The background knowledge provides information about the most popular explanation for the shower-curtain effect.

What is the butterfly effect?,"The butterfly effect describes a phenomenon in chaos theory whereby a minor change in circumstances can cause a large change in outcome. In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or velocity of an object in a given Hamiltonian system, the quantum butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the Hamiltonian system with a given initial position and velocity. He noted that the butterfly effect is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several weeks earlier. The butterfly effect concept has since been used outside the context of weather science as a broad term for any situation where a small change is supposed to be the cause of larger consequences. ==History== In The Vocation of Man (1800), Johann Gottlieb Fichte says ""you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole"".","The butterfly effect is a physical cause that occurs when a massive sphere is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium, and its velocity is assumed to be caused by the force of gravity accelerating it.",The butterfly effect is a distributed causality that opens up the opportunity to understand the relationship between necessary and sufficient conditions in classical (Newtonian) physics.,The butterfly effect is a proportionality between the cause and the effect of a physical phenomenon in classical (Newtonian) physics.,The butterfly effect is a small push that is needed to set a massive sphere into motion when it is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium.,The butterfly effect is a phenomenon that highlights the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a more general use of causality as represented by Mackie's INUS conditions.,E,True,"The background knowledge provided explains the concept of the butterfly effect in chaos theory.

What is the propagation constant in sinusoidal waves?,"The phase of the sinusoid varies with distance which results in the propagation constant being a complex number, the imaginary part being caused by the phase change. ==Alternative names== The term ""propagation constant"" is somewhat of a misnomer as it usually varies strongly with ω.

What is spontaneous symmetry breaking?,"Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetric state spontaneously ends up in an asymmetric state. The term ""spontaneous symmetry breaking"" is a misnomer here as Elitzur's theorem states that local gauge symmetries can never be spontaneously broken. When a theory is symmetric with respect to a symmetry group, but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry. ==Overview== By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of physical laws (e.g. quantum mechanics) which are invariant under a symmetry transformation (such as translation or rotation), so that any pair of outcomes differing only by that transformation have the same probability distribution. If there is a field (often a background field) which acquires an expectation value (not necessarily a vacuum expectation value) which is not invariant under the symmetry in question, we say that the system is in the ordered phase, and the symmetry is spontaneously broken.

What is the information loss paradox in black holes?,"This perspective holds that Hawking's computation is reliable until the final stages of black-hole evaporation when information suddenly escapes.

Starting in the mid-1970s, Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein put forward theoretical arguments that suggested that black-hole evaporation loses information, and is therefore inconsistent with unitarity.

The value of circulation of the flow around the airfoil must be that value which would cause the Kutta condition to exist. == The Kutta condition applied to airfoils == thumb|right|400px|Upper figure: Zero- circulation flow pattern around an airfoil. One of the consequences of the Kutta condition is that the airflow over the topside of the airfoil travels much faster than the airflow under the underside. The Kutta condition is an alternative method of incorporating some aspects of viscous effects, while neglecting others, such as skin friction and some other boundary layer effects. In fluid flow around a body with a sharp corner, the Kutta condition refers to the flow pattern in which fluid approaches the corner from above and below, meets at the corner, and then flows away from the body.","The Kutta condition is a physical requirement that the fluid moving along the lower and upper surfaces of an airfoil meet smoothly, with no fluid moving around the trailing edge of the airfoil.","The Kutta condition is a physical requirement that the fluid moving along the lower and upper surfaces of an airfoil meet smoothly, with no fluid moving around the leading edge of the airfoil.",The Kutta condition is a mathematical requirement that the loop used in applying the Kutta-Joukowski theorem must be chosen outside the boundary layer of the airfoil.,The Kutta condition is a mathematical requirement that the flow can be assumed inviscid in the entire region outside the airfoil provided the Reynolds number is large and the angle of attack is small.,The Kutta condition is a physical requirement that the circulation calculated using the loop corresponding to the surface of the airfoil must be zero for a viscous fluid.,A,True,"The background knowledge provides information about the Kutta condition in aerodynamics.

What are some models that attempt to account for all observations without invoking supplemental non-baryonic matter?,"At the same time, a census of baryons in the recent observable universe has found that observed baryonic matter accounts for less than half of that amount. This form of dark matter is composed of ""baryons"", heavy subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons and combinations of these, including non-emitting ordinary atoms. ==Presence== Baryonic dark matter may occur in non-luminous gas or in Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) – condensed objects such as black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, very faint stars, or non-luminous objects like planets and brown dwarfs. ==Estimates of quantity== The total amount of baryonic dark matter can be inferred from models of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and observations of the cosmic microwave background. This is highly nontrivial, since although luminous matter such as stars and galaxies are easily summed, baryonic matter can also exist in highly non-luminous form, such as black holes, planets, and highly diffuse interstellar gas.

What is the reason for the formation of stars exclusively within molecular clouds?,"This is a natural consequence of their low temperatures and high densities, because the gravitational force acting to collapse the cloud must exceed the internal pressures that are acting ""outward"" to prevent a collapse. There is observed evidence that the large, star-forming clouds are confined to a large degree by their own gravity (like stars, planets, and galaxies) rather than by external pressure. The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well- supported by observation, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds. In triggered star formation, one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its gravitational collapse.

Separately from photophoresis, in a fluid mixture of different kinds of particles, the migration of some kinds of particles may be due to differences in their absorptions of thermal radiation and other thermal effects collectively known as thermophoresis.

What is a virtual particle?,"Virtual photons are referred to as ""virtual"" because they do not exist as free particles in the traditional sense but instead serve as intermediate particles in the exchange of force between other particles. Virtual photons are said to be ""off-shell"", which means that they do not obey the usual relationship between energy and momentum that applies to real particles. In particle physics, V was a generic name for heavy, unstable subatomic particles that decay into a pair of particles, thereby producing a characteristic letter V in a bubble chamber or other particle detector. Virtual photons are a fundamental concept in particle physics and quantum field theory that play a crucial role in describing the interactions between electrically charged particles. Virtual photons are thought of as fluctuations in the electromagnetic field, characterized by their energy, momentum, and polarization.

A typical nano-FTIR setup thus consists of an atomic force microscope, a broadband infrared light source used for tip illumination, and a Michelson interferometer acting as Fourier-transform spectrometer. A mathematical approach Fourier Transform converts the raw data into spectrum. === Advantages === * The FTIR technique uses a polychromatic beam of light with a wide range of continuous frequencies simultaneously, and therefore allows a much higher speed of scanning versus the conventional monochromatic dispersive spectroscopy.

What is the origin of the permanent moment in paramagnetism?,"In magnetic materials, the cause of the magnetic moment are the spin and orbital angular momentum states of the electrons, and varies depending on whether atoms in one region are aligned with atoms in another. === Magnetic pole model === thumb|upright|An electrostatic analog for a magnetic moment: two opposing charges separated by a finite distance. These unpaired dipoles (often called simply ""spins"", even though they also generally include orbital angular momentum) tend to align in parallel to an external magnetic field leading to a macroscopic effect called paramagnetism. This dipole moment comes from the more fundamental property of the electron that it has quantum mechanical spin. It is these intrinsic magnetic moments that give rise to the macroscopic effects of magnetism, and other phenomena, such as electron paramagnetic resonance. In this definition, the magnetic dipole moment of a system is the negative gradient of its intrinsic energy, , with respect to external magnetic field: : \mathbf{m} = -\hat\mathbf x\frac{\partial U_{\rm int}}{\partial B_x}-\hat\mathbf y\frac{\partial U_{\rm int}}{\partial B_y} -\hat\mathbf z\frac{\partial U_{\rm int}}{\partial B_z}.

What is the reason that Newton's second law cannot be used to calculate the development of a physical system in quantum mechanics?,"The successes of kinetic theory gave further credence to the idea that matter is composed of atoms, yet the theory also had shortcomings that would only be resolved by the development of quantum mechanics. The first applications of quantum mechanics to physical systems were the algebraic determination of the hydrogen spectrum by Wolfgang Pauli and the treatment of diatomic molecules by Lucy Mensing. ==Modern quantum mechanics== Heisenberg formulated an early version of the uncertainty principle in 1927, analyzing a thought experiment where one attempts to measure an electron's position and momentum simultaneously. Early pioneers of quantum physics saw applications of quantum mechanics in biological problems. The history of quantum mechanics is a fundamental part of the history of modern physics.

"What is the butterfly effect, as defined by Lorenz in his book ""The Essence of Chaos""?","In the book entitled The Essence of Chaos published in 1993, Lorenz defined butterfly effect as: ""The phenomenon that a small alteration in the state of a dynamical system will cause subsequent states to differ greatly from the states that would have followed without the alteration."" In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. The butterfly effect describes a phenomenon in chaos theory whereby a minor change in circumstances can cause a large change in outcome. While the ""butterfly effect"" is often explained as being synonymous with sensitive dependence on initial conditions of the kind described by Lorenz in his 1963 paper (and previously observed by Poincaré), the butterfly metaphor was originally applied to work he published in 1969 which took the idea a step further.

What is the reason for the stochastic nature of all observed resistance-switching processes?,"In the latter case no price level drift is allowed away from the predetermined path, while in the former case any stochastic change to the price level permanently affects the expected values of the price level at each time along its future path.

What happens to an initially inhomogeneous physical system that is isolated by a thermodynamic operation?,"It is an axiom of thermodynamics that an isolated system eventually reaches internal thermodynamic equilibrium, when its state no longer changes with time. The internal energy of a thermally isolated system may therefore change due to the exchange of work energy. Thermodynamic systems may be isolated, closed, or open. In thermodynamics, a thermally isolated system can exchange no mass or heat energy with its environment. In thermodynamics, a mechanically isolated system is a system that is mechanically constraint to disallow deformations, so that it cannot perform any work on its environment. ",It will change its internal state only if it is composed of a single subsystem and has internal walls.,It will change its internal state only if it is composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls.,It will remain in its initial state indefinitely.,It will generally change its internal state over time.,It will change its internal state only if it is composed of a single subsystem.,D,True,"Based on the background knowledge, an isolated system eventually reaches internal thermodynamic equilibrium, when its state no longer changes with time.

What are coherent turbulent structures?,"By defining and identifying coherent structure in this manner, turbulent flows can be decomposed into coherent structures and incoherent structures depending on their coherence, particularly their correlations with their vorticity. Turbulent flows are complex multi-scale and chaotic motions that need to be classified into more elementary components, referred to coherent turbulent structures. Hence, similarly organized events in an ensemble average of organized events can be defined as a coherent structure, and whatever events not identified as similar or phase and space aligned in the ensemble average is an incoherent turbulent structure. Other attempts at defining a coherent structure can be done through examining the correlation between their momenta or pressure and their turbulent flows. Furthermore, a coherent structure is defined as a turbulent flow whose vorticity expression, which is usually stochastic, contains orderly components that can be described as being instantaneously coherent over the spatial extent of the flow structure.

What is the function of mammary glands in mammals?,"A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in humans and other mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, sheep, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). The number and positioning of mammary glands varies widely in different mammals. These mammary glands are modified sweat glands. == Structure== The basic components of a mature mammary gland are the alveoli (hollow cavities, a few millimeters large), which are lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells and surrounded by myoepithelial cells. They not only help to support mammary basic structure, but also serve as a communicating bridge between mammary epithelia and their local and global environment throughout this organ's development. ===Histology=== thumb|Normal histology of the breast. thumb|upright|Light micrograph of a human proliferating mammary gland during estrous cycle.

The corpuscular theory of light, favored by Isaac Newton and accepted by nearly all of Fresnel's seniors, easily explained rectilinear propagation: the corpuscles obviously moved very fast, so that their paths were very nearly straight.

What is the relationship between chemical potential and quarks/antiquarks?,"Most physicists simply refer to ""the number of bottom quarks"" and ""the number of bottom antiquarks"". ==Further reading== * Category:Quarks Category:Flavour (particle physics) Likewise, the potential has been extended to include spin-dependent terms ==Calculation of the quark-quark potential== A test of validity for approaches that seek to explain color confinement is that they must produce, in the limit that quark motions are non-relativistic, a potential that agrees with the Cornell potential. Up, charm and top quarks have an electric charge of +⅔, while the down, strange, and bottom quarks have an electric charge of −⅓. The strong interactions binding the quarks together are insensitive to these quantum numbers, so variation of them leads to systematic mass and coupling relationships among the hadrons in the same flavor multiplet.

What is the American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity?,"API gravity is thus an inverse measure of a petroleum liquid's density relative to that of water (also known as specific gravity). The American Petroleum Institute gravity, or API gravity, is a measure of how heavy or light a petroleum liquid is compared to water: if its API gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water; if less than 10, it is heavier and sinks. API has entered petroleum industry nomenclature in a number of areas: * API gravity, a measure of the density of petroleum. API gravity is graduated in degrees on a hydrometer instrument. The scale was so firmly established that, by 1921, the remedy implemented by the American Petroleum Institute was to create the API gravity scale, recognizing the scale that was actually being used.API Degree history ==API gravity formulas== The formula to calculate API gravity from specific gravity (SG) is: :\text{API gravity} = \frac{141.5}{\text{SG}} - 131.5 Conversely, the specific gravity of petroleum liquids can be derived from their API gravity value as :\text{SG at}~60^\circ\text{F} = \frac{141.5}{\text{API gravity} + 131.5} Thus, a heavy oil with a specific gravity of 1.0 (i.e., with the same density as pure water at 60 °F) has an API gravity of: :\frac{141.5}{1.0} - 131.5 = 10.0^\circ{\text{API}} ==Using API gravity to calculate barrels of crude oil per metric ton== In the oil industry, quantities of crude oil are often measured in metric tons.",API gravity is a measure of how heavy or light a petroleum liquid is compared to water.

What are the two main factors that cause resistance in a metal?,"Specific properties are designed into metal components to make them more robust to various environmental conditions. Metal components are designed to withstand the environment and stresses that they will be subjected to. The design of a metal component involves not only a specific elemental composition but also specific manufacturing process such as heat treatments, machining processes, etc. Newton's metal is a fusible alloy with a low melting point. The huge arrays of different metals that result all have unique physical properties. ","The amount of resistance in a metal is mainly caused by the temperature and the pressure applied to the metal. Higher temperatures cause bigger vibrations, and pressure causes the metal to become more compact, leading to more resistance.","The amount of resistance in a metal is mainly caused by the temperature and the purity of the metal. Higher temperatures cause bigger vibrations, and a mixture of different ions acts as an irregularity.","The amount of resistance in a metal is mainly caused by the temperature and the thickness of the metal.

What is the significance of the redshift-distance relationship in determining the expansion history of the universe?,"The theory of relativity predicts phenomena associated with the expansion, notably the redshift-versus-distance relationship known as Hubble's Law; functional forms for cosmological distance measurements that differ from what would be expected if space were not expanding; and an observable change in the matter and energy density of the universe seen at different lookback times. Hubble's contribution was to show that the magnitude of the redshift correlated strongly with the distance to the galaxies. To determine the distance of distant objects, astronomers generally measure luminosity of standard candles, or the redshift factor 'z' of distant galaxies, and then convert these measurements into distances based on some particular model of spacetime, such as the Lambda-CDM model. However, galaxies lying farther away from this will recede away at ever-increasing speed and be redshifted out of our range of visibility. ===Metric expansion and speed of light=== At the end of the early universe's inflationary period, all the matter and energy in the universe was set on an inertial trajectory consistent with the equivalence principle and Einstein's general theory of relativity and this is when the precise and regular form of the universe's expansion had its origin (that is, matter in the universe is separating because it was separating in the past due to the inflaton field). Redshift is directly observable and used by cosmologists as a direct measure of lookback time. ","Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used to determine the expansion history of the universe and the matter and energy content, especially for galaxies whose light has been travelling to us for much shorter times.","Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used to determine the age of the universe and the matter and energy content, especially for nearby galaxies whose light has been travelling to us for much shorter times.","Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used to determine the expansion history of the universe and the matter and energy content, especially for nearby galaxies whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times.","Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used to determine the age of the universe and the matter and energy content, especially for distant galaxies whose light has been travelling to us for much shorter times.","Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used to determine the expansion history of the universe and the matter and energy content, especially for distant galaxies whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times.",E,True,"The background knowledge states that the redshift-distance relationship, known as Hubble's Law, is significant in determining the expansion history of the universe.

What is the Evans balance?,"An Evans balance, also known as a Johnson's balance (after a commercial producer of the Evans balance) is a device for measuring magnetic susceptibility. The Evans balance employs a similar sample configuration but measures the force on the magnet. ==Mechanism== The suspension trip has two pairs of magnets placed back-to-back, making a balanced system with a magnetic field at each end. The original Evans balance had an accuracy within 1% of literature values for diamagnetic solutions and within 2% of literature values of paramagnetic solids. The original Evans balance was described by the English scientist Dennis F. Evans in 1973, based on a torsional balance developed in 1937 by Alexander Rankine. Moreover, using a Evans balance is less time-consuming than using a Gouy or Faraday balances, although it is not sensitive and accurate in comparison to these last two systems.","The Evans balance is a system used to measure the change in weight of a sample when an electromagnet is turned on, which is proportional to the susceptibility.",The Evans balance is a system used to measure the dependence of the NMR frequency of a liquid sample on its shape or orientation to determine its susceptibility.,The Evans balance is a system used to measure the magnetic field distortion around a sample immersed in water inside an MR scanner to determine its susceptibility.,The Evans balance is a system used to measure the susceptibility of a sample by measuring the force change on a strong compact magnet upon insertion of the sample.,"The Evans balance is a system used to measure the magnetic susceptibility of most crystals, which is not a scalar quantity.",D,True,"Based on the background knowledge, the Evans balance is a device used to measure magnetic susceptibility.

What is accelerator-based light-ion fusion?,"Heavy ion fusion is a fusion energy concept that uses a stream of high-energy ions from a particle accelerator to rapidly heat and compress a small pellet of fusion fuel. This is the HIF approach's major downside; although it is possible to build an accelerator with less beam current for testing purposes, the individual ions still require the same energy and thus the accelerator will be a similar size as a higher-current version for a production reactor. ===Advantages over lasers=== There are significant practical advantages to the use of ions over lasers. Migma uses self-intersecting beams of ions from small particle accelerators to force the ions to fuse. The types of experiments done at a particular accelerator facility are determined by characteristics of the generated particle beam such as average energy, particle type, intensity, and dimensions. ==Acceleration and interaction of particles with RF structures== While it is possible to accelerate charged particles using electrostatic fields, like in a Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier, this method has limits given by electrical breakdown at high voltages.

What is the significance of the change in slope of the pinched hysteresis curves in ReRAM and other forms of two-terminal resistance memory?,"Whether redox- based resistively switching elements (ReRAM) are covered by the current memristor theory is disputed. Leon Chua argued that all two- terminal non-volatile memory devices including ReRAM should be considered memristors. ReRAM bears some similarities to conductive-bridging RAM (CBRAM) and phase- change memory (PCM). Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM or RRAM) is a type of non-volatile (NV) random-access (RAM) computer memory that works by changing the resistance across a dielectric solid-state material, often referred to as a memristor.

What is the definition of an improper rotation?,"The ""improper rotation"" term refers to isometries that reverse (flip) the orientation. In contrast, the reflectional symmetry is not a precise symmetry law of nature. ==Generalizations== The complex-valued matrices analogous to real orthogonal matrices are the unitary matrices \mathrm{U}(n), which represent rotations in complex space. A rotation is different from other types of motions: translations, which have no fixed points, and (hyperplane) reflections, each of them having an entire -dimensional flat of fixed points in a -dimensional space. As it was already stated, a (proper) rotation is different from an arbitrary fixed-point motion in its preservation of the orientation of the vector space. The circular symmetry is an invariance with respect to all rotation about the fixed axis.

"What is power density in the context of energy systems, and how does it differ between renewable and non-renewable energy sources?","Power density is the amount of power (time rate of energy transfer) per unit volume. Energy density differs from energy conversion efficiency (net output per input) or embodied energy (the energy output costs to provide, as harvesting, refining, distributing, and dealing with pollution all use energy). In energy transformers including batteries, fuel cells, motors, power supply units etc., power density refers to a volume, where it is often called volume power density, expressed as W/m3. In physics, energy density is the amount of energy stored in a given system or region of space per unit volume. This extremely high power density distinguishes nuclear power plants (NPP's) from any thermal power plants (burning coal, fuel or gas) or any chemical plants and explains the large redundancy required to permanently control the neutron reactivity and to remove the residual heat from the core of NPP's. ==Energy density of electric and magnetic fields== Electric and magnetic fields store energy.","Power density is a measure of the amount of power obtained per unit of Earth surface area used by a specific energy system, including all supporting infrastructure, manufacturing, mining of fuel (if applicable) and decommissioning.

What is linear frame dragging?,"Linear frame dragging is the similarly inevitable result of the general principle of relativity, applied to linear momentum. Frame-dragging is an effect on spacetime, predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, that is due to non-static stationary distributions of mass–energy. While not strictly a frame dragging effect (the term frame dragging is not used by Einstein), it is demonstrated by Einstein that it derives from the same equation of general relativity. Although it arguably has equal theoretical legitimacy to the ""rotational"" effect, the difficulty of obtaining an experimental verification of the effect means that it receives much less discussion and is often omitted from articles on frame-dragging (but see Einstein, 1921).Einstein, A The Meaning of Relativity (contains transcripts of his 1921 Princeton lectures). In 2015, new general-relativistic extensions of Newtonian rotation laws were formulated to describe geometric dragging of frames which incorporates a newly discovered antidragging effect. ==Effects== Rotational frame-dragging (the Lense–Thirring effect) appears in the general principle of relativity and similar theories in the vicinity of rotating massive objects.",Linear frame dragging is the effect of the general principle of relativity applied to the mass of a body when other masses are placed nearby.

What is explicit symmetry breaking in theoretical physics?,"In theoretical physics, explicit symmetry breaking is the breaking of a symmetry of a theory by terms in its defining equations of motion (most typically, to the Lagrangian or the Hamiltonian) that do not respect the symmetry.

What is the role of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model?,"Fermions, such as the leptons and quarks in the Standard Model, can also acquire mass as a result of their interaction with the Higgs field, but not in the same way as the gauge bosons. === Structure of the Higgs field === In the standard model, the Higgs field is an SU(2) doublet (i.e. the standard representation with two complex components called isospin), which is a scalar under Lorentz transformations. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs mechanism is essential to explain the generation mechanism of the property ""mass"" for gauge bosons. The Alternative models to the Standard Higgs Model are models which are considered by many particle physicists to solve some of the Higgs boson's existing problems.

What is Lorentz symmetry or Lorentz invariance in relativistic physics?,"In relativistic physics, Lorentz symmetry or Lorentz invariance, named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, is an equivalence of observation or observational symmetry due to special relativity implying that the laws of physics stay the same for all observers that are moving with respect to one another within an inertial frame.

In a relativistic theory of physics, a Lorentz scalar is an expression, formed from items of the theory, which evaluates to a scalar, invariant under any Lorentz transformation. Lorentz invariance follows from two independent postulates: the principle of relativity and the principle of constancy of the speed of light. In particular, a Lorentz covariant scalar (e.g., the space-time interval) remains the same under Lorentz transformations and is said to be a Lorentz invariant (i.e., they transform under the trivial representation).

What can be inferred about the electronic entropy of insulators and metals based on their densities of states at the Fermi level?,"As the density of states at the Fermi level varies widely between systems, this approximation is a reasonable heuristic for inferring when it may be necessary to include electronic entropy in the thermodynamic description of a system; only systems with large densities of states at the Fermi level should exhibit non-negligible electronic entropy (where large may be approximately defined as ). == Application to different materials classes == Insulators have zero density of states at the Fermi level due to their band gaps. Metals have non-zero density of states at the Fermi level. Metals with free-electron-like band structures (e.g. alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Cu, and Al) generally exhibit relatively low density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore exhibit fairly low electronic entropies. Electronic entropy is thus most relevant for the thermodynamics of condensed phases, where the density of states at the Fermi level can be quite large, and the electronic entropy can thus contribute substantially to thermodynamic behavior. Several other approximations can be made, but they all indicate that the electronic entropy should, to first order, be proportional to the temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level.

What are permutation-inversion groups?,"In mathematics, a permutation group is a group G whose elements are permutations of a given set M and whose group operation is the composition of permutations in G (which are thought of as bijective functions from the set M to itself). The way in which the elements of a permutation group permute the elements of the set is called its group action. Group actions have applications in the study of symmetries, combinatorics and many other branches of mathematics, physics and chemistry. == Basic properties and terminology == Being a subgroup of a symmetric group, all that is necessary for a set of permutations to satisfy the group axioms and be a permutation group is that it contain the identity permutation, the inverse permutation of each permutation it contains, and be closed under composition of its permutations.

What is the relationship between dielectric loss and the transparency of a material?,"If a dielectric material does not include light-absorbent additive molecules (pigments, dyes, colorants), it is usually transparent to the spectrum of visible light.

What is the difference between redshift due to the expansion of the universe and Doppler redshift?,"The redshift due to expansion of the universe depends upon the recessional velocity in a fashion determined by the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe, which is very different from how Doppler redshift depends upon local velocity.. There is a distinction between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. The redshifts of galaxies include both a component related to recessional velocity from expansion of the universe, and a component related to peculiar motion (Doppler shift). Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts () are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. Popular literature often uses the expression ""Doppler redshift"" instead of ""cosmological redshift"" to describe the redshift of galaxies dominated by the expansion of spacetime, but the cosmological redshift is not found using the relativistic Doppler equationOdenwald & Fienberg 1993 which is instead characterized by special relativity; thus is impossible while, in contrast, is possible for cosmological redshifts because the space which separates the objects (for example, a quasar from the Earth) can expand faster than the speed of light.Speed faster than light is allowed because the expansion of the spacetime metric is described by general relativity in terms of sequences of only locally valid inertial frames as opposed to a global Minkowski metric.","Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the rate of change of a(t) at the times of emission or absorption, while Doppler redshift depends on the increase of a(t) in the whole period from emission to absorption.","Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the local velocity of the object emitting the light, while Doppler redshift depends on the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe.",There is no difference between redshift due to the expansion of the universe and Doppler redshift.,"Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe, while Doppler redshift depends on the local velocity of the object emitting the light.","Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the increase of a(t) in the whole period from emission to absorption, while Doppler redshift depends on the rate of change of a(t) at the times of emission or absorption.",D,True,"The background knowledge provides a clear distinction between redshift due to the expansion of the universe and Doppler redshift.

What is the cause of the observed change in the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet when measured from Earth?,"The length of day of other planets also varies, particularly of the planet Venus, which has such a dynamic and strong atmosphere that its length of day fluctuates by up to 20 minutes. ==Observations== thumb|Deviation of day length from SI based day Any change of the axial component of the atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) must be accompanied by a corresponding change of the angular momentum of Earth's crust and mantle (due to the law of conservation of angular momentum).

What is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and how does it affect Earth's magnetosphere?,"thumb|right|Numerical simulation of a temporal Kelvin–Helmholtz instability The Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (after Lord Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz) is a fluid instability that occurs when there is velocity shear in a single continuous fluid or a velocity difference across the interface between two fluids. If the density and velocity vary continuously in space (with the lighter layers uppermost, so that the fluid is RT-stable), the dynamics of the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability is described by the Taylor–Goldstein equation: (U-c)^2\left({d^2\tilde\phi \over d z^2} - k^2\tilde\phi\right) +\left[N^2-(U-c){d^2 U \over d z^2}\right]\tilde\phi = 0, where N = \sqrt{g / L_\rho} denotes the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, U is the horizontal parallel velocity, k is the wave number, c is the eigenvalue parameter of the problem, \tilde\phi is complex amplitude of the stream function.

What is the significance of the high degree of fatty-acyl disorder in the thylakoid membranes of plants?,"On the thylakoid membranes are photosynthetic pigments, including chlorophyll a. Chloroplasts in plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism. === pH === Because of the H+ gradient across the thylakoid membrane, the interior of the thylakoid is acidic, with a pH around 4, while the stroma is slightly basic, with a pH of around 8.

What is the relationship between the complete electromagnetic Hamiltonian of a molecule and the parity operation?,"Wiley To see that the parity's eigenvalues are phase factors, we assume an eigenstate of the parity operation (this is realized because the intrinsic parity is a property of a particle species) and use the fact that two parity transformations leave the particle in the same state, thus the new wave function can differ by only a phase factor, i.e.: P^{2} \psi = e^{i \phi} \psi thus P \psi = \pm e^{i \phi /2} \psi, since these are the only eigenstates satisfying the above equation. In quantum mechanics, the intrinsic parity is a phase factor that arises as an eigenvalue of the parity operation x_i \rightarrow x_i' = -x_i (a reflection about the origin).Griffiths, D., (1987). Since the parity commutes with the Hamiltonian and \frac{dP}{dt} = 0 its eigenvalue does not change with time, therefore the intrinsic parities phase is a conserved quantity. The intrinsic parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles, for instance for noninteracting particles we have P(|1\rangle|2\rangle)=(P|1\rangle)(P|2\rangle). As [P,H]=0 the Hamiltonian is invariant under a parity transformation.","The complete electromagnetic Hamiltonian of any molecule is invariant to the parity operation, and its eigenvalues cannot be given the parity symmetry label + or -.","The complete electromagnetic Hamiltonian of any molecule is dependent on the parity operation, and its eigenvalues can be given the parity symmetry label even or odd, respectively.","The complete electromagnetic Hamiltonian of any molecule is dependent on the parity operation, and its eigenvalues can be given the parity symmetry label + or - depending on whether they are even or odd, respectively.","The complete electromagnetic Hamiltonian of any molecule is invariant to the parity operation, and its eigenvalues can be given the parity symmetry label + or - depending on whether they are even or odd, respectively.","The complete electromagnetic Hamiltonian of any molecule does not involve the parity operation, and its eigenvalues cannot be given the parity symmetry label + or -.",D,False,fail
What is the difference between active and passive transport in cells?,"Passive transport is a type of membrane transport that does not require energy to move substances across cell membranes. Instead of using cellular energy, like active transport, passive transport relies on the second law of thermodynamics to drive the movement of substances across cell membranes.

What is the difference between natural convection and forced convection?,"* Forced convection: when a fluid is forced to flow over the surface by an internal source such as fans, by stirring, and pumps, creating an artificially induced convection current.http://www.engineersedge.com/heat_transfer/convection.htm Engineers Edge, 2009, ""Convection Heat Transfer"",Accessed 20/04/09 In many real-life applications (e.g. heat losses at solar central receivers or cooling of photovoltaic panels), natural and forced convection occur at the same time (mixed convection). Forced convection is type of heat transport in which fluid motion is generated by an external source like a (pump, fan, suction device, etc.).

"What is the throttling process, and why is it important?","A throttle is the mechanism by which fluid flow is managed by constriction or obstruction. However, liquid-propellant rockets can be throttled by means of valves which regulate the flow of fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber. The ""secondary"" throttle is operated either mechanically when the primary plate is opened past a certain amount, or via engine vacuum, influenced by the position of the accelerator pedal and engine load, allowing for greater air flow into the engine at high RPM and load and better efficiency at low RPM. Throttle bodies may also contain valves and adjustments to control the minimum airflow during idle. Throttling can be used to actively limit a user's upload and download rates on programs such as video streaming, BitTorrent protocols and other file sharing applications, as well as even out the usage of the total bandwidth supplied across all users on the network.

How can applied epistemology be defined based on the provided Wikipedia excerpt?,"Applied epistemology refers to the study that determines whether the systems of investigation that seek the truth lead to true beliefs about the world. Once applied epistemology is described as a method in an epistemological search, it implies that the methodology is supported by an epistemological foundation. == Background == Applied epistemology forms part of the concept of ""applied philosophy"" as theorists begin to distinguish it from ""applied ethics"". A proposed analogy to distinguish applied epistemology from epistemology holds that it involves the general opposition between theory and application. It is considered an applied epistemology due to the characterization that it is precise, formal, and normative. Applied epistemology emerged out of epistemologists routine examinations that determine whether truth-seeking practices like science and mathematics are capable of delivering truths.

What is the distinguishing feature of Mesopropithecus among sloth lemurs?,"However, as it had the shortest forelimbs of all sloth lemurs, it is thought that Mesopropithecus was more quadrupedal and did not use suspension as much as the other sloth lemurs.

With the discovery of an associated skeleton of M. dolichobrachion near Ankarana in 1986, it became clear that Mesopropithecus shared distinct traits with sloth lemurs. Wrist bones found in 1999 further demonstrate that Mesopropithecus was a vertical climber and the most loris-like of the sloth lemurs.

What was the primary intention behind the use of the double A-side format by Boney M. for their singles?,"By the mid-1970s, it was used to refer to 12"" vinyl singles with three or four tracks (or an extended or remixed version of the lead single/song) on the A-side, with an additional two or three tracks on the B-side; the B-side was initially used by DJs. The term came into wide use in the 1970s, where it usually referred to 7-inch vinyl singles featuring one track on the A-side and two on the B-side. From early 2003, a format described as a ""Maxi-CD"" was reintroduced, alongside a new two-track CD single with a lower retail price. While Maxi-CDs had been much loved among the dance community, as most if not all of the remixes that had been commissioned by the label could be released commercially, lobbying by artists in other genres who felt obliged to record extra and cover tracks to provide enough material for their single releases was responsible for the rule change. This was packaged in a 12"" × 3"" cassette maxi single longbox (with a regular cardboard slipcase/cassette inside), although most later maxi singles were just issued in regular style cassette cases. ==CD maxi singles== When CDs began to appear as a popular single format in the early 1990s (see CD single), songs were occasionally released in two CD formats simultaneously, 3"" and 5"", predominantly as a marketing ploy but potentially as a logical extension of the 7"" and 12"" vinyl record formats to CD, with the 5"" CD sometimes marketed as a ""maxi-single"", most commonly in the US, and European countries (outside of the UK).",The double A-side format was used to have one song intended for radio and another specifically targeted at discos.,The double A-side format was used to increase the chances of chart success by releasing multiple songs simultaneously.,"The double A-side format was used to maximize the length of the single by including two songs, providing more value to the consumer.",The double A-side format was used to showcase the versatility of their musical style by featuring contrasting songs on the same release.,The double A-side format was used to showcase rarely performed songs that were featured only on promotional releases.,A,True,"The double A-side format was initially used by DJs and later became popular for 7-inch vinyl singles with one track on the A-side and two on the B-side. Considering this, option A) The double A-side format was used to have one song intended for radio and another specifically targeted at discos seems like a plausible intention behind the use of the double A-side format by Boney M. for their singles."

What is the anabolic:androgenic ratio of Methoxydienone relative to testosterone propionate and nandrolone?,"The drug is a potent anabolic when administered via injection with an anabolic:androgenic ratio of approximately 54:27 relative to testosterone propionate and 90:625 relative to nandrolone.

The combination of nandrolone with a 5α-reductase inhibitor like finasteride or dutasteride will block the conversion of nandrolone into 5α-DHN and, unlike with testosterone and various other AAS, thereby considerably increase the propensity of nandrolone for producing androgenic side effects. ==See also== * 19-Norandrosterone * 19-Noretiocholanolone * 5α-Dihydronorethandrolone * 5α-Dihydronorethisterone * 5α-Dihydrolevonorgestrel * 5α-Dihydroethisterone ==References== Category:5α-Reduced steroid metabolites Category:Cyclopentanols Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Estranes Category:Human drug metabolites Category:Ketones MOHN is the 4-hydroxylated derivative of normethandrone (17α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), the 17α-methylated derivative of oxabolone (4-hydroxy-19-nortestosterone), the 4-hydroxylated and 17α-methylated derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), and the 19-demethylated analogue of oxymesterone (4-hydroxy-17α-methyltestosterone). ==See also== * List of androgens/anabolic steroids ==References== ==External links== * 4-Estren-17α-methyl-4,17β-diol-3-one - Steraloids Category:Enols Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Estranes Category:Hepatotoxins Category:Enones Category:World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited substances",Approximately 90:625 relative to testosterone propionate and 54:27 relative to nandrolone.,Approximately 27:54 relative to testosterone propionate and 625:90 relative to nandrolone.,Approximately 54:27 relative to nandrolone and 90:625 relative to testosterone propionate.,Approximately 27:54 relative to nandrolone and 625:90 relative to testosterone propionate.,Approximately 54:27 relative to testosterone propionate and 90:625 relative to nandrolone.,E,False,fail

Invariance is an important concept in modern theoretical physics, and many theories are expressed in terms of their symmetries and invariants. ==Examples== In classical and quantum mechanics, invariance of space under translation results in momentum being an invariant and the conservation of momentum, whereas invariance of the origin of time, i.e. translation in time, results in energy being an invariant and the conservation of energy. Covariance and contravariance generalize the mathematical properties of invariance in tensor mathematics, and are frequently used in electromagnetism, special relativity, and general relativity. == See also == * Casimir operator * Charge (physics) * Conservation law * Conserved quantity * General covariance * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors * Invariants of tensors * Killing form * Physical constant * Scalar (physics) * Symmetry (physics) * Uniformity of nature * Weyl transformation == References == Category:Conservation laws Category:Physical quantities Invariance, as a broader term, also applies to the no change of form of physical laws under a transformation, and is closer in scope to the mathematical definition.

How do conservation laws contribute to solving problems in physics?,"Symmetries and conservation laws: Consequences of Noether’s theorem. The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the laws of physics do not change with time itself. In physics, charge conservation is the principle that the total electric charge in an isolated system never changes. The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy, the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as the system's mass cannot change, so the quantity can neither be added nor be removed.

What is the main purpose of statistical mechanics?,"Statistical mechanics arose out of the development of classical thermodynamics, a field for which it was successful in explaining macroscopic physical properties—such as temperature, pressure, and heat capacity—in terms of microscopic parameters that fluctuate about average values and are characterized by probability distributions. In physics, statistical mechanics is a mathematical framework that applies statistical methods and probability theory to large assemblies of microscopic entities. In other words, statistical thermodynamics provides a connection between the macroscopic properties of materials in thermodynamic equilibrium, and the microscopic behaviours and motions occurring inside the material. Sometimes called statistical physics or statistical thermodynamics, its applications include many problems in the fields of physics, biology, chemistry, and neuroscience.

Who developed the fundamental interpretation of entropy?,"These concepts were further developed by James Clerk Maxwell [1871] and Max Planck [1903]. ==Statistical thermodynamic views== In 1877, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a statistical mechanical evaluation of the entropy , of a body in its own given macrostate of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. The concept entropy was first developed by German physicist Rudolf Clausius in the mid-nineteenth century as a thermodynamic property that predicts that certain spontaneous processes are irreversible or impossible. The statistical entropy perspective was introduced in 1870 by Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, who established a new field of physics that provided the descriptive linkage between the macroscopic observation of nature and the microscopic view based on the rigorous treatment of large ensembles of microstates that constitute thermodynamic systems. ==Boltzmann's principle== Ludwig Boltzmann defined entropy as a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, consistent with its macroscopic thermodynamic properties, which constitute the macrostate of the system. The mathematical expressions for thermodynamic entropy in the statistical thermodynamics formulation established by Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs in the 1870s are similar to the information entropy by Claude Shannon and Ralph Hartley, developed in the 1940s. ==Equivalence of form of the defining expressions== The defining expression for entropy in the theory of statistical mechanics established by Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs in the 1870s, is of the form: : S = - k_\text{B} \sum_i p_i \ln p_i , where p_i is the probability of the microstate i taken from an equilibrium ensemble.

Companies use intelligent automation to cut costs by using artificial-intelligence-powered robotic software to replace workers who handle repetitive tasks. Rather than having humans do each step, intelligent automation replaces each step with an intelligent software robot or bot, improving efficiency. ==Applications== The technology is used to process unstructured content. For example, automation of farming and food distribution throughout the world so that no one will go hungry. However in an April 2022 survey by Alchemmy, despite three quarters of businesses acknowledging the importance of Artificial Intelligence to their future development, just a quarter of business leaders (25%) considered Intelligent Automation a “game changer” in understanding current performance. 42% of CTOs see “shortage of talent” as the main obstacle to implementing Intelligent Automation in their business, while 36% of CEOs see ‘upskilling and professional development of existing workforce’ as the most significant adoption barrier. ==See also== *Robotic process automation *Artificial intelligence *Automation ==References== & Category:Business software Category:Automation software Category:Information economy Category:Machine learning",Consumer behavior changes,Profitability and efficiency,Manufacturing floor operations,Covid-19 vaccine distribution,None of the above,B,True,"Based on the background knowledge, intelligent automation can provide real-time insights on profitability and efficiency.

What is the main purpose of predictive analytics?,"Predictive analytics can be used and is capable of providing many benefits to a wide range of businesses, including asset management firms, insurance companies, communication companies, and many other firms. Predictive analytics is often defined as predicting at a more detailed level of granularity, i.e., generating predictive scores (probabilities) for each individual organizational element. Often the unknown event of interest is in the future, but predictive analytics can be applied to any type of unknown whether it be in the past, present or future. The core of predictive analytics relies on capturing relationships between explanatory variables and the predicted variables from past occurrences, and exploiting them to predict the unknown outcome. Predictive analytics can help underwrite these quantities by predicting the chances of illness, default, bankruptcy, etc. Predictive analytics can streamline the process of customer acquisition by predicting the future risk behavior of a customer using application level data.

Which phase of business analytics looks for the reasons behind past success or failure?,"Failure analysis can save money, lives, and resources if done correctly and acted upon. Failure analysis is the process of collecting and analyzing data to determine the cause of a failure, often with the goal of determining corrective actions or liability. The term failure analysis also applies to other fields such as business management and military strategy. ==Failure analysis engineers== A failure analysis engineer often plays a lead role in the analysis of failures, whether a component or product fails in service or if failure occurs in manufacturing or during production processing. Journal of Management Studies, vol. 48, 1727-1751. ==Preventing the success trap== The success trap can be best avoided early on, for example, by closely monitoring how other (e.g. leading) firms maintain a balance between exploitation and exploration activities, as well as by continually collecting information about changing customer needs, newly emerging technologies and other changes in the market and competitive environment.

What is the relationship between a system's consciousness and its causal properties in IIT?,"In IIT, a system's consciousness (what it is like subjectively) is conjectured to be identical to its causal properties (what it is like objectively). Firstly, by not demonstrating that all members of systems which do in fact combine integration and differentiation in the formal IIT sense are conscious, systems which demonstrate high levels of integration and differentiation of information might provide the necessary conditions for consciousness but those combinations of attributes do not amount to the conditions for consciousness. IIT argues that the existence of an underlying causal system with these same properties offers the most parsimonious explanation. Thus a physical system, if conscious, is so by virtue of its causal properties. IIT also makes several predictions which fit well with existing experimental evidence, and can be used to explain some counterintuitive findings in consciousness research.

Which axis is the direct axis component aligned with?,"The first vector identifies the direction of the axis, and the second locates its position. A screw axis (helical axis or twist axis) is a line that is simultaneously the axis of rotation and the line along which translation of a body occurs. Therefore the neutral axis lies on the centroid of the cross section. In geometry, an axis-aligned object (axis-parallel, axis-oriented) is an object in n-dimensional space whose shape is aligned with the coordinate axes of the space.

What is entropy?,"Entropy is a scientific concept, as well as a measurable physical property, that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of ""disorder"" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). In classical thermodynamics, entropy () is a property of a thermodynamic system that expresses the direction or outcome of spontaneous changes in the system. In statistical mechanics, entropy is formulated as a statistical property using probability theory. The traditional qualitative description of entropy is that it refers to changes in the status quo of the system and is a measure of ""molecular disorder"" and the amount of wasted energy in a dynamical energy transformation from one state or form to another.

Who first recognized the concept of entropy?,"The concept entropy was first developed by German physicist Rudolf Clausius in the mid-nineteenth century as a thermodynamic property that predicts that certain spontaneous processes are irreversible or impossible. Building on this logic, and following a mathematical presentation of the first fundamental theorem, Clausius then presented the first-ever mathematical formulation of entropy, although at this point in the development of his theories he called it ""equivalence-value"", perhaps referring to the concept of the mechanical equivalent of heat which was developing at the time rather than entropy, a term which was to come into use later.Mechanical Theory of Heat, by Rudolf Clausius, 1850-1865 He stated:Published in Poggendoff's Annalen, December 1854, vol. xciii. p. 481; translated in the Journal de Mathematiques, vol. xx. Paris, 1855, and in the Philosophical Magazine, August 1856, s. Clausius continued to develop his ideas of lost energy, and coined the term entropy. These concepts were further developed by James Clerk Maxwell [1871] and Max Planck [1903]. ==Statistical thermodynamic views== In 1877, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a statistical mechanical evaluation of the entropy , of a body in its own given macrostate of internal thermodynamic equilibrium.

What does the second law of thermodynamics state?,"The second law may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium where the entropy is highest at the given internal energy. For isolated systems, no energy is provided by the surroundings and the second law requires that the entropy of the system alone must increase: ΔS > 0. The second law of thermodynamics in other versions establishes the concept of entropy as a physical property of a thermodynamic system. In terms of time variation, the mathematical statement of the second law for an isolated system undergoing an arbitrary transformation is: : \frac{dS}{dt} \ge 0 where : S is the entropy of the system and : t is time. They do not offer it as a full statement of the second law: ::... there is only one way in which the entropy of a [closed] system can be decreased, and that is to transfer heat from the system.Borgnakke, C., Sonntag., R.E.

We envision that Mars exploration would begin > and proceed for a long time on the basis of outbound journeys only. The plans for these crews have varied—from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or more, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization, or other continuous habitation).",Waiting for the planets to align and the next launch window to open,Acceleration in another orbital maneuver,Flight time of a little over one year,Crosses the orbit of Mars,Acceleration in a single maneuver to reach Mars,E,True,"The background knowledge provides information about the possibility of a fast Mars mission of round trip with on-orbit staging.

What distinguishes quantum state discrimination from quantum tomography?,"Quantum tomography or quantum state tomography is the process by which a quantum state is reconstructed using measurements on an ensemble of identical quantum states.Quantum State Tomography. Unlike a measurement on a single system, which determines the system's current state after the measurement (in general, the act of making a measurement alters the quantum state), quantum tomography works to determine the state(s) prior to the measurements. Also known as ""quantum estimation"", tomography techniques are increasingly important including those for quantum measurement tomography and the very similar quantum state tomography. Quantum state tomography is a method to determine all these parameters from a series of measurements on many independent and identically prepared systems.

Formally, starting with a linearly independent set of vectors {v1, ... , vk} in an inner product space (most commonly the Euclidean space Rn), orthogonalization results in a set of orthogonal vectors {u1, ... , uk} that generate the same subspace as the vectors v1, ... , vk. This definition can be formalized in Cartesian space by defining the dot product and specifying that two vectors in the plane are orthogonal if their dot product is zero. In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, an orthogonal basis for an inner product space V is a basis for V whose vectors are mutually orthogonal.

What happens when individual quantum states are not orthogonal to each other?,"In quantum information theory, quantum state merging is the transfer of a quantum state when the receiver already has part of the state. It is true that for any pure entangled state there exists a choice of measurements that produce Bell nonlocal correlations, but the situation is more complex for mixed states. It seems, therefore, that, even when the above principles are taken together, they do not suffice to single out the quantum set in the simplest Bell scenario of two parties, two inputs and two outputs. ==Device independent protocols== Nonlocality can be exploited to conduct quantum information tasks which do not rely on the knowledge of the inner workings of the prepare-and-measurement apparatuses involved in the experiment. In theoretical physics, quantum nonlocality refers to the phenomenon by which the measurement statistics of a multipartite quantum system do not admit an interpretation in terms of a local realistic theory.

When is it necessary to consider incorrect or inconclusive determination of the system state?,"No consistent or quantitative definition of a ""failed state"" exists; the subjective nature of the indicators that are used to infer state failure have led to an ambiguous understanding of the term. The conclusion that a state is failing or has failed can be drawn from the observation of a variety of characteristics and combinations thereof. Call does not necessarily suggest that states that suffer from the challenges of the three gaps should be identified as failed states but instead presents the framework as an alternative to the state failure concept as a whole. These cases are not branded 'failed states. == Measurement == The measurement methods of state failure are generally divided into the quantitative and qualitative approach. ===Quantitative approach=== Quantitative measurement of state failure means the creation of indexes and rankings are particularly important. Olivier Nay, William Easterly, and Laura Freschi have critiqued the concept of state failure as not having a coherent definition, with indices combining various indicators of state performance arbitrarily weighted to arrive at unclear and aggregated measurements of state fragility.Nay Olivier.

What is a persistence barcode?,"In topological data analysis, a persistence barcode, sometimes shortened to barcode, is an algebraic invariant of a persistence module that characterizes the stability of topological features throughout a growing family of spaces.

What is a persistence module?,"A persistence module often consists of a collection of homology groups (or vector spaces if using field coefficients) corresponding to a filtration of topological spaces, and a collection of linear maps induced by the inclusions of the filtration. A persistence module is a mathematical structure in persistent homology and topological data analysis that formally captures the persistence of topological features of an object across a range of scale parameters. Homology modules are the most ubiquitous examples of persistence modules, as they encode information about the number and scale of topological features of an object (usually derived from building a filtration on a point cloud) in a purely algebraic structure, thus making understanding the shape of the data amenable to algebraic techniques, imported from well-developed areas of mathematics such as commutative algebra and representation theory. === Interval Modules === A primary concern in the study of persistence modules is whether modules can be decomposed into ""simpler pieces"", roughly speaking. A persistence module indexed by a discrete poset such as the integers can be represented intuitively as a diagram of spaces: \cdots \to M_{-1} \to M_0 \to M_1 \to M_2 \to \cdots To emphasize the indexing set being used, a persistence module indexed by P is sometimes called a P-persistence module, or simply a P-module.

Least absolute deviations (LAD), also known as least absolute errors (LAE), least absolute residuals (LAR), or least absolute values (LAV), is a statistical optimality criterion and a statistical optimization technique based on minimizing the sum of absolute deviations (also sum of absolute residuals or sum of absolute errors) or the L1 norm of such values. The term minimum distance may refer to * Minimum distance estimation, a statistical method for fitting a model to data * Closest pair of points problem, the algorithmic problem of finding two points that have the minimum distance among a larger set of points * Euclidean distance, the minimum length of any curve between two points in the plane * Shortest path problem, the minimum length of a path between two points in a graph * The minimum distance of a block code in coding theory, the smallest Hamming distance between any two of its code words Similarly, a lower bound is said to be a tight lower bound, a greatest lower bound, or an infimum, if no greater value is a lower bound. ==Exact upper bounds== An upper bound of a subset of a preordered set is said to be an exact upper bound for if every element of that is strictly majorized by is also majorized by some element of .

What is the definition of absolute value?,"In mathematics, the absolute value or modulus of a real number x, is the non-negative value without regard to its sign. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them. This is equivalent to the definition above, and may be used as an alternative definition of the absolute value of real numbers. When x itself is negative then its absolute value is necessarily positive From an analytic geometry point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's distance from zero along the real number line, and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers (their absolute difference) is the distance between them. This generalizes the alternative definition for reals: The complex absolute value shares the four fundamental properties given above for the real absolute value.

The two primary types of marine heat exchangers used aboard vessels in the maritime industry are plate, and shell and tube. This has a major advantage over a conventional heat exchanger in that the fluids are exposed to a much larger surface area because the fluids are spread out over the plates. Thus to design plate heat exchangers, one should consider both factors. A plate-fin heat exchanger is a type of heat exchanger design that uses plates and finned chambers to transfer heat between fluids, most commonly gases.

At cryogenic (very low) temperatures around 20 K, the specific heat of metals is low, and so a regenerator must be larger for a given heat load. == Advantages of regenerators == The advantages of a regenerator over a recuperating (counter-flowing) heat exchanger is that it has a much higher surface area for a given volume, which provides a reduced exchanger volume for a given energy density, effectiveness and pressure drop. A regenerative heat exchanger, or more commonly a regenerator, is a type of heat exchanger where heat from the hot fluid is intermittently stored in a thermal storage medium before it is transferred to the cold fluid. The heat transfer coefficient is much lower for gases than for liquids, thus the enormous surface area in a regenerator greatly increases heat transfer. == Disadvantages of regenerators == The major disadvantage of rotary and fixed- matrix regenerators is that there is always some mixing of the fluid streams, and they can not be completely separated.",To increase their efficiency,To prevent fouling and galvanic corrosion,To improve their cooling capacity,To reduce their footprint,To make them compatible with non-marine applications,fail,False,fail
What determines the passageways for fluid flow in plate-type marine heat exchangers?,"The plates are designed in such a way that when placed next to each other they create passageways to the fluid to flow between the plates. In the corrugated plate heat exchangers, because of narrow path between the plates, there is a large pressure capacity and the flow becomes turbulent along the path. The plates are pressed to form troughs at right angles to the direction of flow of the liquid which runs through the channels in the heat exchanger. A layout configuration of plate heat exchanger can be usually simplified into a manifold system with two manifold headers for dividing and combining fluids, which can be categorized into U-type and Z-type arrangement according to flow direction in the headers, as shown in manifold arrangement. The plate geometry is one of the most important factor in heat transfer and pressure drop in plate heat exchangers, however such a feature is not accurately prescribed.

What is the definition of a materials property?,"A materials property is an intensive property of a material, i.e., a physical property that does not depend on the amount of the material. Physical properties are contrasted with chemical properties which determine the way a material behaves in a chemical reaction. ==List of properties== The physical properties of an object that are traditionally defined by classical mechanics are often called mechanical properties. A property may be a constant or may be a function of one or more independent variables, such as temperature. A physical property is any property that is measurable, whose value describes a state of a physical system. Materials properties that relate to different physical phenomena often behave linearly (or approximately so) in a given operating range . ",A property that depends on the amount of the material,A property that is a function of temperature,A physical property that does not depend on the amount of the material,A property that varies according to the direction in the material,A property that behaves linearly in a given operating range,C,True,"The background knowledge provides a clear definition of materials property as a physical property that does not depend on the amount of the material. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
What is anisotropy in materials properties?,"Physicists use the term anisotropy to describe direction-dependent properties of materials. Anisotropy () is the property of a material which allows it to change or assume different properties in different directions, as opposed to isotropy. This can be a source of interpretation error for inexperienced practitioners. ===Materials science and engineering=== Anisotropy, in materials science, is a material's directional dependence of a physical property. The word anisotropy means ""directionally dependent"", hence the definition. In condensed matter physics, magnetic anisotropy describes how an object's magnetic properties can be different depending on direction. ",A condition in which properties vary with temperature,A condition in which properties vary with direction in the material,A condition in which properties are constant,A condition in which properties are function of one or more independent variables,A condition in which properties behave linearly in a given operating range,B,True,"Anisotropy is the property of a material which allows it to change or assume different properties in different directions, as opposed to isotropy. This is a directional dependence of a physical property. Therefore, the answer is B) A condition in which properties vary with direction in the material."
Why are equations describing relevant materials properties often used?,"Equations describing relevant materials properties are often used to predict the attributes of a system. These quantitative properties may be used as a metric by which the benefits of one material versus another can be compared, thereby aiding in materials selection. Modeling them as linear functions can significantly simplify the differential constitutive equations that are used to describe the property. Materials properties that relate to different physical phenomena often behave linearly (or approximately so) in a given operating range . The properties are measured by standardized test methods.

Therefore, option A, B, and C are all correct. However, the primary reason for using these equations is to predict the attributes of a system, so option A is the best answer."
What is the atomic mass of an element?,"The atomic mass of atoms, ions, or atomic nuclei is slightly less than the sum of the masses of their constituent protons, neutrons, and electrons, due to binding energy mass loss (per ). == Relative isotopic mass == Relative isotopic mass (a property of a single atom) is not to be confused with the averaged quantity atomic weight (see above), that is an average of values for many atoms in a given sample of a chemical element. The atomic mass (ma or m) is the mass of an atom. In general, the mass in daltons of an atom is numerically close but not exactly equal to the number of nucleons contained in its nucleus. Thus, the numeric value of the atomic mass when expressed in daltons has nearly the same value as the mass number. The atomic mass (relative isotopic mass) of an uncommon isotope can differ from the relative atomic mass, atomic weight, or standard atomic weight, by several mass units. ",The average mass of the atoms of an element,The number of protons in each nucleus,The mass of each atom in daltons,The relative mass of an atom in atomic mass units,The mass of the electrons in each atom,A,True,"The background knowledge explains that the atomic mass is the mass of an atom, which is slightly less than the sum of the masses of its constituent protons, neutrons, and electrons due to binding energy mass loss.

What is the atomic number of an atom or pure element?,"An atomic value may refer to: *Atomic number, the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom *A piece of data in a database table that cannot be broken down any further (see first normal form) An effective atomic number in this context is equivalent to the atomic number but is used for compounds (e.g. water) and mixtures of different materials (such as tissue and bone). The transuranium elements (also known as transuranic elements) are the chemical elements with atomic numbers greater than 92, which is the atomic number of uranium. One such proposed formula for the effective atomic number, , is as follows: Z_\text{eff} = \sqrt[2.94]{f_{1} \times (Z_{1})^{2.94} + f_{2} \times (Z_{2})^{2.94} + f_{3} \times (Z_{3})^{2.94} + \cdots} where * f_n is the fraction of the total number of electrons associated with each element, and * Z_n is the atomic number of each element.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) To maintain a sensed variable at a reference value."
How are reference values set in engineering control theory?,"The value of control is a quantitative measure of the value of controlling the outcome of an uncertain variable. In computer programming, a reference is a value that enables a program to indirectly access a particular data, such as a variable's value or a record, in the computer's memory or in some other storage device. Typically, a reference refers to data stored in memory on a given system, and its internal value is the memory address of the data, i.e. a reference is implemented as a pointer. In particular, a reference may point to a variable or record that contains references to other data. Obtaining meaningful value-of-control measurements requires an awareness of important restrictions (concerning the nature of free will and the meaning of counterfactual statements) on the validity of this kind of analysis. ==See also== *Value of information *Wizard Category:Valuation (finance) Category:Free will ",By a user outside the system,By the physical properties of the environment,By the control loop itself,By the endogenous maintenance of the organism,By feedback from other variables in the system,fail,False,fail

The differential is defined in modern treatments of differential calculus as follows.See, for instance, the influential treatises of , , , and . This yields yet another refinement of the notion of differential: that it should be a linear function of a kinematic velocity. Likewise, in differential geometry, the differential of a function at a point is a linear function of a tangent vector (an ""infinitely small displacement""), which exhibits it as a kind of one-form: the exterior derivative of the function. In mathematics, differential of the first kind is a traditional term used in the theories of Riemann surfaces (more generally, complex manifolds) and algebraic curves (more generally, algebraic varieties), for everywhere-regular differential 1-forms.",The derivatives of functions,Infinitesimal differences,The concept of infinitely small changes,The linearization of a function,The generalization for functions of multiple variables,C,True,"The background knowledge provides a clear definition of the term 'differential' in mathematics.

Which branches of mathematics use the term differential?,"In mathematics, differential algebra is, broadly speaking, the area of mathematics consisting in the study of differential equations and differential operators as algebraic objects in view of deriving properties of differential equations and operators without computing the solutions, similarly as polynomial algebras are used for the study of algebraic varieties, which are solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. Many of these concepts are widely used in algebraic geometry, differential geometry and secondary calculus. In mathematics the differential calculus over commutative algebras is a part of commutative algebra based on the observation that most concepts known from classical differential calculus can be formulated in purely algebraic terms. In mathematics, differential of the first kind is a traditional term used in the theories of Riemann surfaces (more generally, complex manifolds) and algebraic curves (more generally, algebraic varieties), for everywhere-regular differential 1-forms.

How is the differential dx defined in calculus?,"Since dx(x,\Delta x)=\Delta x, it is conventional to write dx=\Delta x so that the following equality holds: df(x) = f'(x) \, dx This notion of differential is broadly applicable when a linear approximation to a function is sought, in which the value of the increment \Delta x is small enough. In calculus, the differential represents the principal part of the change in a function y = f(x) with respect to changes in the independent variable. The differential dy is defined by dy = f'(x)\,dx, where f'(x) is the derivative of with respect to x, and dx is an additional real variable (so that dy is a function of x and dx). Traditionally, the variables dx and dy are considered to be very small (infinitesimal), and this interpretation is made rigorous in non- standard analysis. ==History and usage== The differential was first introduced via an intuitive or heuristic definition by Isaac Newton and furthered by Gottfried Leibniz, who thought of the differential as an infinitely small (or infinitesimal) change in the value of the function, corresponding to an infinitely small change in the function's argument . This leads directly to the notion that the differential of a function at a point is a linear functional of an increment \Delta x.

What does the formula dy/dx represent?,"In physics, the differential coefficient of a function f(x) is what is now called its derivative df(x)/dx, the (not necessarily constant) multiplicative factor or coefficient of the differential dx in the differential df(x). When f is not linear, its differential coefficient is a function, call it f′, derived by the differentiation of f, hence, the modern term, derivative. A coefficient is usually a constant quantity, but the differential coefficient of f is a constant function only if f is a linear function. In his 1998 update of this text, Martin Gardner lets the first use of ""differential coefficient"" stand, along with Thompson's criticism of the term as a needlessly obscure phrase that should not intimidate students, and substitutes ""derivative"" for the remainder of the book.

What causes an electron to move in a circle in a static and uniform magnetic field?,"Furthermore, if a magnetic field is present, a traveling electron will be deflected by the Lorentz force.

How can an ionized plasma be efficiently produced or heated?,"In plasma physics, a burning plasma is one in which most of the heating comes from fusion reactions involving thermal plasma ions. The high temperatures needed to sustain fusion reactions are maintained by a self-heating process in which energy from the fusion reaction heats the thermal plasma ions via particle collisions. To reach fusion-relevant temperatures, the ITER tokamak will heat plasmas using three methods: ohmic heating (running electric current through the plasma), neutral particle beam injection, and high-frequency electromagnetic radiation. Issues to be explored include understanding and controlling a strongly coupled, self-organized plasma; management of heat and particles that reach plasma-facing surfaces; demonstration of fuel breeding technology; and the physics of energetic particles. A plasma enters what scientists call the burning plasma regime when the self- heating power exceeds any external heating.

The term ""synthetic geometry"" has been coined only after the 17th century, and the introduction by René Descartes of the coordinate method, which was called analytic geometry. Synthetic differential geometry is an application of topos theory to the foundations of differentiable manifold theory. ==See also== * Foundations of geometry * Incidence geometry * Synthetic differential geometry ==Notes== ==References== * * * Halsted, G. B. (1896) Elementary Synthetic Geometry via Internet Archive * Halsted, George Bruce (1906) Synthetic Projective Geometry, via Internet Archive.

What is a form of differential geometry without the notion of smoothness from calculus called?,"Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that studies the geometry of smooth shapes and smooth spaces, otherwise known as smooth manifolds. Differential geometry is also related to the geometric aspects of the theory of differential equations, otherwise known as geometric analysis. Differential geometry of curves is the branch of geometry that deals with smooth curves in the plane and the Euclidean space by methods of differential and integral calculus. Differential geometry is closely related to, and is sometimes taken to include, differential topology, which concerns itself with properties of differentiable manifolds that do not rely on any additional geometric structure (see that article for more discussion on the distinction between the two subjects). The adjective abstract has often been applied to differential geometry before, but the abstract differential geometry (ADG) of this article is a form of differential geometry without the calculus notion of smoothness, developed by Anastasios Mallios and Ioannis Raptis from 1998 onwards.""Geometry of Vector Sheaves: An Axiomatic Approach to Differential Geometry"", Anastasios Mallios, Springer, 1998, Instead of calculus, an axiomatic treatment of differential geometry is built via sheaf theory and sheaf cohomology using vector sheaves in place of bundles based on arbitrary topological spaces.""Modern Differential Geometry in Gauge Theories: Maxwell fields"", Anastasios Mallios, Springer, 2005, Mallios says noncommutative geometry can be considered a special case of ADG, and that ADG is similar to synthetic differential geometry. ==Applications== ===ADG Gravity=== Mallios and Raptis use ADG to avoid the singularities in general relativity and propose this as a route to quantum gravity. ==See also== *Discrete differential geometry *Analysis on fractals ==References== ==Further reading== *Space-time foam dense singularities and de Rham cohomology, A Mallios, EE Rosinger, Acta Applicandae Mathematicae, 2001 Category:Differential geometry Category:Sheaf theory Category:General relativity Category:Quantum gravity",Abstract algebra,Abstract differential geometry,Absolute geometry,Absolute differential calculus,Abstract analytic number theory,B,True,"The background knowledge provides the answer to the question.

What is an older name of Ricci calculus?,"In mathematics, Ricci calculus constitutes the rules of index notation and manipulation for tensors and tensor fields on a differentiable manifold, with or without a metric tensor or connection. It is also the modern name for what used to be called the absolute differential calculus (the foundation of tensor calculus), developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro in 1887–1896, and subsequently popularized in a paper written with his pupil Tullio Levi-Civita in 1900. The description of tensor fields and operations on them in terms of their components is the focus of the Ricci calculus. Expressions in the notation of the Ricci calculus may generally be interpreted as a set of simultaneous equations relating the components as functions over a manifold, usually more specifically as functions of the coordinates on the manifold. For compactness and convenience, the Ricci calculus incorporates Einstein notation, which implies summation over indices repeated within a term and universal quantification over free indices.",Abstract differential geometry,Abstract algebra,Absolute differential calculus,Absolute geometry,Analytic number theory,C,True,"The background knowledge provides the historical context and the origin of Ricci calculus. It states that Ricci calculus was previously known as the absolute differential calculus, which makes option C the correct answer."

What does Bézout's identity state about the solution of water pouring puzzles?,"By Bézout's identity, such puzzles have solution if and only if the desired volume is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of all the integer volume capacities of jugs. ==Rules== It is a common assumption, stated as part of these puzzles, that the jugs in the puzzle are irregularly shaped and unmarked, so that it is impossible to accurately measure any quantity of water that does not completely fill a jug. Another variant is when one of the jugs has a known volume of water to begin with; In that case, the achievable volumes are either a multiple of the greatest common divisor between the two containers away from the existing known volume, or from zero. Initially each jug contains a known integer volume of liquid, not necessarily equal to its capacity. Puzzles of this type ask how many steps of pouring water from one jug to another (until either one jug becomes empty or the other becomes full) are needed to reach a goal state, specified in terms of the volume of liquid that must be present in some jug or jugs. Other assumptions of these problems may include that no water can be spilled, and that each step pouring water from a source jug to a destination jug stops when either the source jug is empty or the destination jug is full, whichever happens first. ==Standard example== The standard puzzle of this kind works with three jugs of capacity 8, 5 and 3 liters.",The desired volume must be a multiple of the greatest common divisor of all the integer volume capacities of jugs,The desired volume can be any integer value,The desired volume must be equal to the sum of all the integer volume capacities of jugs,The desired volume must be less than the capacity of the largest jug,The desired volume must be greater than the sum of all the integer volume capacities of jugs,A,True,"Bézout's identity states that such puzzles have a solution if and only if the desired volume is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of all the integer volume capacities of jugs.

What is the standard example of a water pouring puzzle?,"Other assumptions of these problems may include that no water can be spilled, and that each step pouring water from a source jug to a destination jug stops when either the source jug is empty or the destination jug is full, whichever happens first. ==Standard example== The standard puzzle of this kind works with three jugs of capacity 8, 5 and 3 liters. The graph shows two ways to obtain 4 liters using 3-liter and 5-liter jugs, and a water source and sink on a Cartesian grid with diagonal lines of slope −1 (such that x+y=const. on these diagonal lines, which represent pouring water from one jug to the other jug). Water pouring puzzles (also called water jug problems, decanting problems, measuring puzzles, or Die Hard with a Vengeance puzzles) are a class of puzzle involving a finite collection of water jugs of known integer capacities (in terms of a liquid measure such as liters or gallons). Puzzles of this type ask how many steps of pouring water from one jug to another (until either one jug becomes empty or the other becomes full) are needed to reach a goal state, specified in terms of the volume of liquid that must be present in some jug or jugs. For example, if one jug that holds 8 liters is empty and the other jug that hold 12 liters has 9 liters of water in it to begin with, then with a source (tap) and a drain (sink), these two jugs can measure volumes of 9 liters, 5 liters, 1 liter, as well as 12 liters, 8 liters, 4 liters and 0 liters.","Three jugs with capacities 6, 4, and 2 liters","Three jugs with capacities 10, 7, and 5 liters","Three jugs with capacities 8, 5, and 3 liters","Three jugs with capacities 12, 9, and 6 liters","Three jugs with capacities 15, 12, and 9 liters",C,True,"The background knowledge mentions that the standard puzzle of this kind works with three jugs of capacity 8, 5 and 3 liters."
How many steps are needed to solve the standard water pouring puzzle example?,"Puzzles of this type ask how many steps of pouring water from one jug to another (until either one jug becomes empty or the other becomes full) are needed to reach a goal state, specified in terms of the volume of liquid that must be present in some jug or jugs. Therefore, there are only two solutions to the problem: :(5, 0) ↔ (0, 5) ↔ (12, 5) ↔ (9, 8) ↔ (9, 0) :(5, 0) ↔ (5, 8) ↔ (12, 1) ↔ (0, 1) ↔ (1, 0) ↔ (1, 8) ↔ (9, 0) For the 4 liter question, since 4\equiv 0 \\! \mod \\!4, one irreversible action is necessary at the start of the solution; It could be simply pouring the whole 9 liters of water from the 12-liter jug to the sink (0,0), or fully fill it to 12 liters from the tap (12,0). Other assumptions of these problems may include that no water can be spilled, and that each step pouring water from a source jug to a destination jug stops when either the source jug is empty or the destination jug is full, whichever happens first. ==Standard example== The standard puzzle of this kind works with three jugs of capacity 8, 5 and 3 liters. Filling a jug to the rim from the tap or pouring the entire contents of jug into the drain each count as one step while solving the problem. The solver must pour the water so that the first and second jugs both contain 4 units, and the third is empty.",Four steps,Six steps,Seven steps,Eight steps,Ten steps,C,True,"The standard puzzle of this kind works with three jugs of capacity 8, 5 and 3 liters. Filling a jug to the rim from the tap or pouring the entire contents of jug into the drain each count as one step while solving the problem. The solver must pour the water so that the first and second jugs both contain 4 units, and the third is empty. Therefore, we can solve the problem by pouring water from the 8-liter jug to the 5-liter jug and then from the 5-liter jug to the 3-liter jug. This takes 2 steps. Then, we can pour the water from the 3-liter jug to the 8-liter jug, fill the 3-liter jug again, pour water from the 3-liter jug to the 8-liter jug until the 8-liter jug is full, and then pour the remaining water from the 3-liter jug to the 5-liter jug. This takes 5 more steps. Therefore, the total number of steps needed to solve the standard water pouring puzzle example is 7 steps."
Which actions in water pouring puzzles are reversible?,"Again, if we restrict ourselves to reversible actions only, from the desired point (5,0), there are only two reversible actions: transferring 5 liter of water from the 12-liter jug to the 8-liter jug (0,5), or filling the empty 8 liter jug to full from the tap (5,8). The puzzle may be solved in seven steps, passing through the following sequence of states (denoted as a bracketed triple of the three volumes of water in the three jugs): :[8,0,0] → [3,5,0] → [3,2,3] → [6,2,0] → [6,0,2] → [1,5,2] → [1,4,3] → [4,4,0]. writes that this particular puzzle ""dates back to mediaeval times"" and notes its occurrence in Bachet's 17th-century mathematics textbook. == Reversibility of actions == Since the rules only allows stopping/turning on the boundaries of the Cartesian grid (i.e. at the full capacities of each jug), the only reversible actions (reversible in one step) are: * Transferring water from a full jug to any jug * Transferring water from any jug to an empty jug The only irreversible actions that can't be reversed in one step are: * Transferring water from a partially full jug to another partially full jug By restricting ourselves to reversible actions only, we can construct the solution to the problem from the desired result. From the point (4, 0), there are only two reversible actions: filling the empty 3-liter jug to full from the tap (4,3), or transferring 1 liter of water from the 5-liter jug to the 3-liter jug (1,3). From the point [4,4,0], there are only two reversible action: Transferring 3 liters from the 8 liter jug to the empty 3 liter jug [1,4,3], or transferring 3 liters from the 5 liter jug to the empty 3 liter jug [4,1,3].

Principal stratification is a statistical technique used in causal inference when adjusting results for post-treatment covariates. ==Methodology== === General === Causal inference is conducted via the study of systems where the measure of one variable is suspected to affect the measure of another. This leads to using the variables representing phenomena happening earlier as treatment effects, where econometric tests are used to look for later changes in data that are attributed to the effect of such treatment effects, where a meaningful difference in results following a meaningful difference in treatment effects may indicate causality between the treatment effects and the measured effects (e.g., Granger-causality tests). Causal inference is the process of determining the independent, actual effect of a particular phenomenon that is a component of a larger system. ",J,T,D,R,Y,fail,False,fail

What is the study of geometry of numbers over the ring of adeles called?,"The study of geometry of numbers over the ring of adeles of a number field is called adelic geometry. ==Definition== Let K be a global field (a finite extension of \mathbf{Q} or the function field of a curve X/\mathbf{F_{\mathit{q}}} over a finite field). In mathematics, the adele ring of a global field (also adelic ring, ring of adeles or ring of adèles) is a central object of class field theory, a branch of algebraic number theory. The ring of adeles allows one to describe the Artin reciprocity law, which is a generalisation of quadratic reciprocity, and other reciprocity laws over finite fields. Geometry of numbers is the part of number theory which uses geometry for the study of algebraic numbers. In mathematics, arithmetic geometry is roughly the application of techniques from algebraic geometry to problems in number theory.

What is the shape of a pistol boiler firebox?,"It consists of a cylindrical horizontal shell with a cylindrical furnace and fire-tubes within this. As the boiler was small, with a barrel diameter of only 2', it was practical to form the deeply curved plates for the inner and outer firebox with a hydraulic press. The front face of this cone was flattened inwards to form the firebox tubeplate. 54 1½-inch fire-tubes were used. They thus have their tubes arranged radially, so as to seat more easily by entering the firebox perpendicular to the plate. === Robertson boiler === The design by Robertson of Fleetwood, Lancashire, was originally used in steam wagons.

What was the main problem with the firebox of a traditional locomotive boiler?,"Note the narrow water spaces around the firebox and the ""mudhole"" for access to the crown sheet: these areas require special attention during washout The working life of a locomotive boiler is considerably extended if it is spared from a constant cycle of cooling and heating. Above this size, such as for large steam ships, it was more usual to install multiple boilers. === Locomotive boiler === A locomotive boiler has three main components: a double-walled firebox; a horizontal, cylindrical ""boiler barrel"" containing a large number of small flue-tubes; and a smokebox with chimney, for the exhaust gases. Category:Steam locomotive fireboxes These two factors account for most of the variability of the efficiency gains experienced at different installations. == Maintenance == An intensive schedule of maintenance is needed to keep a high pressure railway steam boiler in safe condition. === Daily inspection === The tube plates, the fusible plug and the heads of the firebox stays should be checked for leaks. The typical locomotive firebox of the day was long and narrow, fitting in between the locomotive's frames.

What kind of boilers were already using cylindrical stayless fireboxes?,"This limited the space available for the firebox, a disadvantage which could be avoided, for small locos, by the use of Bagnall's boiler with a circular firebox entirely above the frames. == Railway locomotives == Launch-type boilers were only rarely used for railway locomotives, although they were notably used by Sir Arthur Heywood from 1874 for his minimum gauge railways at Duffield Bank and Eaton Hall. They thus have their tubes arranged radially, so as to seat more easily by entering the firebox perpendicular to the plate. === Robertson boiler === The design by Robertson of Fleetwood, Lancashire, was originally used in steam wagons.

What shapes were combined in the cylindrical stayless firebox design?,"Today it generally refers to the shape of the outer shell of the firebox which is approximately flat at the top and square in cross-section, indicated by the longitudinal ridges on the top sides.

What is the main purpose of ocean fertilization?,"In fact, fertilization is an important process that occurs naturally in the ocean waters. Ocean fertilization occurs naturally when upwellings bring nutrient-rich water to the surface, as occurs when ocean currents meet an ocean bank or a sea mount. However, although this approach could be looked upon as an easy option to lower the concentration of in the atmosphere, ocean iron fertilization is still quite controversial and highly debated due to possible negative consequences on marine ecosystems. Ocean nutrient fertilization, for example iron fertilization, could stimulate photosynthesis in phytoplankton. Nitrogen released by cetaceans and iron chelate are a significant benefit to the marine food chain in addition to sequestering carbon for long periods of time. ==== Ocean acidification ==== A 2009 study tested the potential of iron fertilization to reduce both atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidity using a global ocean carbon model.",To reduce surface ocean acidity,To increase marine food production,To remove pollutants from the atmosphere,To decrease ocean mixing times,To increase deep ocean acidity,B,True,"Ocean fertilization, such as iron fertilization, could stimulate photosynthesis in phytoplankton, which is a significant benefit to the marine food chain in addition to sequestering carbon for long periods of time. However, ocean iron fertilization is still quite controversial and highly debated due to possible negative consequences on marine ecosystems."
Which nutrient is commonly used in ocean fertilization experiments?,"As oceanic phosphorus is depleted (via sequestration) it would have to be included in the fertilization cocktail supplied from terrestrial sources. == Approaches == ""Ocean fertilisation options are only worthwhile if sustained on a millennial timescale and phosphorus addition may have greater long-term potential than iron or nitrogen fertilisation."" A number of techniques, including fertilization by the micronutrient iron (called iron fertilization) or with nitrogen and phosphorus (both macronutrients), have been proposed. Ocean nutrient fertilization, for example iron fertilization, could stimulate photosynthesis in phytoplankton. Research on this area has suggested that fertilization through deposition of large quantities of iron-rich dust into the ocean floor can significantly disrupt the ocean's nutrient balance and cause major complications in the food chain for other marine organisms. ==Methods== There are two ways of performing artificial iron fertilization: ship based direct into the ocean and atmospheric deployment. ===Ship based deployment=== Trials of ocean fertilization using iron sulphate added directly to the surface water from ships are described in detail in the experiment section below. ===Atmospheric sourcing=== Iron-rich dust rising into the atmosphere is a primary source of ocean iron fertilization.

How much can iron fertilization increase photosynthesis in phytoplankton?,"After several days the phytoplankton in the samples with iron fertilization grew much more than in the untreated samples. Iron fertilization is the intentional introduction of iron to iron-poor areas of the ocean surface to stimulate phytoplankton production. Fertilization increases phytoplankton only in the open oceans (far from shore) where iron deficiency is substantial. Iron fertilization attempts to encourage phytoplankton growth, which removes carbon from the atmosphere for at least a period of time. Therefore, small amounts of iron (measured by mass parts per trillion) in HNLC zones can trigger large phytoplankton blooms on the order of 100,000 kilograms of plankton per kilogram of iron.",2 times,10 times,30 times,50 times,100 times,fail,False,fail
What is one of the risks associated with nutrient fertilization?,"Atmospheric deposition (e.g., in the form of acid rain) can also affect nutrient concentration in water, especially in highly industrialized regions. == Impacts == === Environmental and economic impacts === Excess nutrients have been summarized as potentially leading to: * Excess growth of algae (harmful algal blooms); and biodiversity loss; * Species composition shifts (dominant taxa); * Food web changes, light limitation; * Excess organic carbon (eutrophication); dissolved oxygen deficits (environmental hypoxia); toxin production; Nutrient pollution can have economic impacts due to increasing water treatment costs, commercial fishing and shellfish losses, recreational fishing losses, and reduced tourism income. === Health impacts === Human health effects include excess nitrate in drinking water (blue baby syndrome) and disinfection by-products in drinking water. These nutrients can eventually end up in aquatic ecosystems and are a contributor to increased eutrophication. For many coastal water bodies, the main pollutant issue is excess nutrients, also termed nutrient over-enrichment. In order to gauge how to best prevent eutrophication from occurring, specific sources that contribute to nutrient loading must be identified. It is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters (lakes, rivers and coastal waters), in which excess nutrients, usually nitrogen or phosphorus, stimulate algal growth.

What is specific impulse?,"Specific impulse (usually abbreviated ) is a measure of how efficiently a reaction mass engine (a rocket using propellant or a jet engine using fuel) creates thrust. In other words, given a particular engine and a mass of a particular propellant, specific impulse measures for how long a time that engine can exert a continuous force (thrust) until fully burning that mass of propellant. Specific impulse measures the impulse produced per unit of propellant and is proportional to the exhaust velocity. In an atmospheric context, specific impulse can include the contribution to impulse provided by the mass of external air that is accelerated by the engine in some way, such as by an internal turbofan or heating by fuel combustion participation then thrust expansion or by external propeller.

How does a propulsion system with a higher specific impulse use propellant more efficiently?,"A propulsion system with a higher specific impulse uses the mass of the propellant more efficiently. The higher the specific impulse, the less propellant is needed to produce a given thrust for a given time and the more efficient the propellant is. This should not be confused with the physics concept of energy efficiency, which can decrease as specific impulse increases, since propulsion systems that give high specific impulse require high energy to do so. For engines whose reaction mass is only the fuel they carry, specific impulse is exactly proportional to the effective exhaust gas velocity. By computing the exhaust velocity from the equation for thrust (while still assuming \dot{m}_{exh} = \dot{m}_{in}= \dot{m}), we can also obtain the propulsive efficiency as a function of specific thrust (T / \dot{m}): :\eta_p = \frac{v_0}{v_0 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{T}{\dot{m}}} A corollary of this is that, particularly in air breathing engines, it is more energy efficient to accelerate a large amount of air by a small amount, than it is to accelerate a small amount of air by a large amount, even though the thrust is the same.",By requiring less propellant for a given delta-v,By increasing the actual exhaust velocity of the engine,By decreasing the specific fuel consumption of the system,By accelerating external air in addition to the reaction mass,By using a combination of rocket and jet engines,fail,False,fail

How does specific impulse relate to specific fuel consumption?,"Specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to specific impulse and has units of g/(kN·s) or lb/(lbf·hr). Specific impulse is inversely proportional to specific fuel consumption (SFC) by the relationship for SFC in kg/(N·s) and for SFC in lb/(lbf·hr). ==General considerations== The amount of propellant can be measured either in units of mass or weight. Specific impulse measures the impulse produced per unit of propellant and is proportional to the exhaust velocity. In an atmospheric context, specific impulse can include the contribution to impulse provided by the mass of external air that is accelerated by the engine in some way, such as by an internal turbofan or heating by fuel combustion participation then thrust expansion or by external propeller.

Specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to specific impulse. Therefore, specific impulse is inversely proportional to specific fuel consumption."
How can the amount of propellant be measured?,"For example, the complete Space Shuttle system has:Typical propellant mass fractions * fueled weight at liftoff: 1,708,500 kg * dry weight at liftoff: 342,100 kg Given these numbers, the propellant mass fraction is 1 - (342,100\text{ kg}/1,708,500\text{ kg}) = 0.7998. The propellant mass fraction is the ratio of just the propellant to the entire mass of the vehicle at takeoff (propellant plus dry mass). In other words, the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle. In aerospace engineering, the propellant mass fraction is the portion of a vehicle's mass which does not reach the destination, usually used as a measure of the vehicle's performance.

Which method of color analysis relies on the ability of the naked eye to match colors?,"A color vision test is used for measuring color vision against a standard. Colorimetric analysis is a method of determining the concentration of a chemical element or chemical compound in a solution with the aid of a color reagent. In the visual arts, color theory is the body of practical guidance for color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. The values of the variables at match (and the deviation from the variables of a color normal subject) are used to diagnose the type and severity of colorblindness. Color vision standards for academic use trade speed and simplicity for accuracy and precision. ==Applications== Color vision standards are used to evaluate the color vision of a subject.

What is the purpose of using spectrophotometers in color analysis?,"* A spectrophotometer measures the spectral reflectance, transmittance, or relative irradiance of a color sample. A spectrocolorimeter is simply a spectrophotometer that can estimate tristimulus values by numerical integration (of the color matching functions' inner product with the illuminant's spectral power distribution). Accurate color profiles ensure consistency throughout the imaging workflow, from acquisition to output. === Spectroradiometer, spectrophotometer, spectrocolorimeter === The absolute spectral power distribution of a light source can be measured with a spectroradiometer, which works by optically collecting the light, then passing it through a monochromator before reading it in narrow bands of wavelength. * A spectrocolorimeter is a spectrophotometer that can calculate tristimulus values.

What is the advantage of using handheld spectrophotometers?,"The spectrophotometer is used to measure colored compounds in the visible region of light (between 350 nm and 800 nm), thus it can be used to find more information about the substance being studied. Important features of spectrophotometers are spectral bandwidth (the range of colors it can transmit through the test sample), the percentage of sample- transmission, the logarithmic range of sample-absorption, and sometimes a percentage of reflectance measurement. Spectrophotometers have been developed and improved over decades and have been widely used among chemists. This method is also convenient for use in laboratory experiments because it is an inexpensive and relatively simple process. ==UV-visible spectrophotometry== Most spectrophotometers are used in the UV and visible regions of the spectrum, and some of these instruments also operate into the near-infrared region as well. Qualitative analysis can be used and spectrophotometers are used to record spectra of compounds by scanning broad wavelength regions to determine the absorbance properties (the intensity of the color) of the compound at each wavelength.",They allow comparisons between sample color and database colors without the need for multiple pieces of equipment,They provide more accurate results than visual analysis,They are suitable for analyzing colors on irregular surfaces,They can measure the smell of a specimen,They can conduct qualitative analysis,fail,False,fail
When is digital photography with post-processing used in color analysis?,"Color photography is photography that uses media capable of capturing and reproducing colors. In color photography, electronic sensors or light-sensitive chemicals record color information at the time of exposure. The recorded information is then used to reproduce the original colors by mixing various proportions of red, green and blue light (RGB color, used by video displays, digital projectors and some historical photographic processes), or by using dyes or pigments to remove various proportions of the red, green and blue which are present in white light (CMY color, used for prints on paper and transparencies on film). Monochrome images which have been ""colorized"" by tinting selected areas by hand or mechanically or with the aid of a computer are ""colored photographs"", not ""color photographs"". Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm. ",When conducting visual analysis of soil or powder specimens,When comparing sample color to database colors,"When analyzing colors on a flat, homogeneous solid surface",When conducting quantitative analysis of heterogeneous specimens,When measuring the light absorbed or transmitted by colored objects,D,True,"Digital image processing can be used to analyze colors in various ways. It can be used for quantitative analysis of heterogeneous specimens. It can also be used to compare sample color to database colors. However, it may not be the best option for analyzing colors on a flat, homogeneous solid surface, as this can be done more accurately with other methods. It is not typically used for measuring the light absorbed or transmitted by colored objects. Therefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate answer."

Who articulated the no-cloning theorem?,"This proves the no-cloning theorem. In physics, the no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state, a statement which has profound implications in the field of quantum computing among others.

What is the main difference between a watchmaker and a clockmaker?,"Clockmakers must be able to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to modern time pieces in order to fix and make clocks or watches. Modern clockmakers may be employed by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and watches. A clockmaker is an artisan who makes and/or repairs clocks. Clockmakers generally do not work on watches; the skills and tools required are different enough that watchmaking is a separate field, handled by another specialist, the watchmaker. ==Origins and specialities== The earliest use of the term clokkemaker is said to date from 1390, about a century after the first mechanical clocks appeared. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair clocks.","Watchmakers specialize in repairing watches, while clockmakers specialize in repairing clocks","Watchmakers create customized watches, while clockmakers create customized clocks","Watchmakers fabricate replacement parts, while clockmakers do not","Watchmakers use factory-made spare parts, while clockmakers manufacture all the parts by hand","Watchmakers service current watches, while clockmakers service older watches",A,True,"According to the background knowledge, watchmaking and clockmaking are two separate fields, with different skills and tools required. The article also mentions that clockmakers generally do not work on watches, and that watchmaking is handled by another specialist, the watchmaker. Therefore, option A is the correct answer, as it correctly identifies the main difference between watchmakers and clockmakers based on the information provided in the background knowledge."

Brian Loomes and G.H. Baillie's book lists watchmakers and clockmakers from around the world. Thomas Reid was an English watchmaker who made deck watches. This information suggests that watchmakers repair and fix watches and clocks. Therefore, option B seems to be the most appropriate answer."
What types of watches do modern watchmakers mainly service?,"Microbrand watches are wristwatches produced by small, independent watch companies. == History == The term ""microbrand"" is usually synonymous with the microbrand watch industry, though it can also be more widely used to describe any small-scale brand that is likely only recognized in niche communities and among hobbyists. ==Watchmakers== This list is a duplicate of :Category:Watchmakers, which will likely be more up-to-date and complete. As a result, the prices of microbrand watches are generally significantly lower than luxury-tier watches, despite being produced in the same factories. ==See also== * List of watch manufacturers ==References== Category:Time measurement systems Category:Horology Category:Watch brands Category:Watch manufacturing companies Category:Watches With the advent of the Internet, brands were able to distribute watches directly to consumers within e-commerce, without taking on the overhead usually associated with luxury goods such as retail locations, marketing budgets, and other associated costs.

What is the set of possible behaviors of agent A?,"There are various definitions of autonomous agent. On this view, an agent has the ability to perform a certain action if there is a complete and consistent way how the world could have been, in which the agent performs the corresponding action. In economics, an agent is an actor (more specifically, a decision maker) in a model of some aspect of the economy.

Why is the time value of money considered when weighing spending and saving?,"In particular, savings (or, for that matter, increases) in travel time form part of the change in consumer surplus for a transport project. ==Calculating the value of time== Values of time are used to calculate the non-monetary costs incurred as part of a journey, so that the generalized cost of the journey (a combination of both monetary and non-monetary costs) can be calculated. In transport economics, the value of time is the opportunity cost of the time that a traveler spends on their journey. In finance, time value is: * Time value of money; or * Time value of an option. Using a set of values of time, the economic benefits of a transport project can be quantified in order to compare them to the costs (thus forming the basis of cost-benefit analysis). The value of non-working time is linked strongly to utility theory. == Forecasting the value of time == The value of time cannot be assumed constant over time.

What is one of the reasons interest is paid or earned?,"The abstinence theory of interest asserts that the money used for lending purposes is the money not used for consumption – which means, earning interest by abstaining from spending makes the funds possible and available for borrowers.EconomyProfessor.com , Retrieved 2008-05-29 The originator of the theory is Nassau William Senior. ==Notes== Category:Interest More generally, a beneficial interest is any ""interest of value, worth, or use in property one does not own"", for example, ""the interest that a beneficiary of a trust has in the trust"".Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 48 (Legal Assistant edition, 1994). A beneficial interest is the right that a person has arising from a contract to which they are not a party, or a trust. \- For example, if A makes a contract with B that A will pay C a certain sum of money, B has the legal interest in the contract, and C the beneficial interest. The interest of the company (sometimes company benefit or commercial benefit) is a concept that the board of directors in corporations are in most legal systems required to use their powers for the commercial benefit of the company and its members.For these purposes, it is important to remember the distinction between objects (what the company is incorporated to do) and powers (how the company may achieve those objects), see generally Cotman v Brougham [1918] AC 514 at 522 At common law, transactions which were not ostensibly beneficial to the company were set aside as being void as against the company. ==Background== An early illustration of this principle is to be found in Hutton v West Cork Railway Co (1883) 23 Ch D 654, where the English Court of Appeal held that the paying of a gratuity to employees prior to their dismissal was an improper exercise of the powers of the company, because the company was no longer a going concern, and thus stood to obtain no benefit (and no furtherance of its objects) through the payment of the gratuity; as Bowen LJ memorably remarked: ""there are to be no cakes and ale except such as are required for the benefit of the company.""",To compensate for the loss of use of money,To encourage people to spend money,To discourage people from saving money,To stabilize the economy,To increase the value of money,A,True,"The background knowledge provides information about the abstinence theory of interest, which asserts that the money used for lending purposes is the money not used for consumption.

Who recognized the time value of money in the Talmud?,"The notion was later described by Martín de Azpilcueta (1491–1586) of the School of Salamanca. ==Calculations== Time value of money problems involve the net value of cash flows at different points in time. In Tractate Makkos page 3a the Talmud discusses a case where witnesses falsely claimed that the term of a loan was 30 days when it was actually 10 years. He describes a sort of thought experiment, in which a government would attempt to trade or confiscate through taxes a portion of all goods in the kingdom, until it finds that the plunder is too diverse and complex to manage, and would then turn to demanding only the trade equivalent in some simple commodities that happen to have the traits seen as useful for money at the time, like compactness, ease of distribution and ease of storage.Della Moneta by Ferdinando Galiani: a Quarter Millennium Assessment ==The Value of Money== Interwoven into the other themes throughout the book is a second premise, that money, and material goods in general, have value based on their utility to people: a premise that was only rediscovered with examination of marginal utility 120 years later.Encyclopedia Britannica: Ferdinando Galiani He even touches upon a modern idea that would not be deeply examined again until the mid 20th century: that the value of money and goods may reach an equilibrium in price, based on supply and demand. Della Moneta (On Money) is a book written by Ferdinando Galiani, and is considered one of the first specific treatises on economics, especially monetary theory, preceding Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations by twenty-five years. ==Summary== Della Moneta is divided into five sections, covering what are still seen today as the standard aspects of monetary theory. Investors are willing to forgo spending their money now only if they expect a favorable net return on their investment in the future, such that the increased value to be available later is sufficiently high to offset both the preference to spending money now and inflation (if present); see required rate of return. ==History== The Talmud (~500 CE) recognizes the time value of money.",Martín de Azpilcueta,The School of Salamanca,Tractate Makkos,The false witnesses,The borrowers,C,True,"The background knowledge mentions that the Talmud recognizes the time value of money in Tractate Makkos page 3a.

What is the phenomenon behind the theory of Brownian motors?,"The theory behind Brownian motors relies on the phenomenon of Brownian motion, random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas) resulting from their collision with the fast-moving molecules in the fluid.

Why is directed motion difficult to achieve on the nanoscale?,"On the nanoscale (1-100 nm), viscosity dominates inertia, and the extremely high degree of thermal noise in the environment makes conventional directed motion all but impossible, because the forces impelling these motors in the desired direction are minuscule when compared to the random forces exerted by the environment. Brownian motors operate specifically to utilise this high level of random noise to achieve directed motion, and as such are only viable on the nanoscale. The operation of such nanomotors relies on classical physics and is related to the concept of Brownian motors. Brownian motors remain a central concept in both the understanding of natural molecular motors and the construction of useful nanoscale machines that involve directed motion. == Theory == thumb|The ratchet model serves as a theoretical underpinning of the Brownian motor.|alt= The thermal noise on the nanoscale is so great that moving in a particular direction is as difficult as “walking in a hurricane” or “swimming in molasses”.

Full BASIC was not simply a version of Minimal with more features, instead, it was based on Dartmouth's Structured BASIC efforts and was designed to offer structured programming to support the construction of large programs. The newer version of SiMPLE integrates the SiMPLE environment with the Windows environment so that many of the old SiMPLE's Command-line commands are no longer necessary and have been eliminated. == Modes of operation == SiMPLE programs can be run in either ""Drag & Drop"" mode (intended primarily for beginning programmers), or in ""Command-Line"" mode (for more advanced programmers): (a) In ""Drag & Drop"" mode, the user simply creates a program source listing (a text document), and then runs that program by dragging the source listing document onto a special icon.

What is entropic gravity?,"Entropic gravity, also known as emergent gravity, is a theory in modern physics that describes gravity as an entropic force—a force with macro-scale homogeneity but which is subject to quantum-level disorder—and not a fundamental interaction.

Who is considered the father of algebraic number theory?,"These properties, such as whether a ring admits unique factorization, the behavior of ideals, and the Galois groups of fields, can resolve questions of primary importance in number theory, like the existence of solutions to Diophantine equations. ==History of algebraic number theory== ===Diophantus=== The beginnings of algebraic number theory can be traced to Diophantine equations,Stark, pp. 145–146. named after the 3rd-century Alexandrian mathematician, Diophantus, who studied them and developed methods for the solution of some kinds of Diophantine equations. Guy Terjanian is a French mathematician who has worked on algebraic number theory.

What is a Diophantine equation?,"In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is an equation, typically a polynomial equation in two or more unknowns with integer coefficients, such that the only solutions of interest are the integer ones. A Diophantine equation, in general, is one where the solutions are restricted to some algebraic system, typically integers. In fact, a Diophantine equation can be viewed as the equation of an hypersurface, and the solutions of the equation are the points of the hypersurface that have integer coordinates. Diophantus and Diophantine Equations is a book in the history of mathematics, on the history of Diophantine equations and their solution by Diophantus of Alexandria. In mathematics, a polynomial Diophantine equation is an indeterminate polynomial equation for which one seeks solutions restricted to be polynomials in the indeterminate.

"In which year did the term ""geomatics"" gain popularity in English?","The term was first employed in a French Ministry of Public Works memorandum dated 1 June 1971 instituting a ""standing committee of geomatics"" in the government. Geomatics is a field that incorporates several others such as the older field of land surveying engineering along with many other aspects of spatial data management ranging from data science and cartography to geography. The word was not originally associated with the idea of language map-making, but had been suggested to him during World War II by a student of his who suggested to him that a new academic discipline was needed which should be called ‘geolinguistics’ by analogy with ‘geopolitics.’”Levitt, Jesse, et al. (1987). Surveying engineering was the widely used name for geomatic(s) engineering in the past. ==History and etymology == The term was proposed in French (""géomatique"") at the end of the 1960s by scientist Bernard Dubuisson to reflect at the time recent changes in the jobs of surveyor and photogrammetrist. The term was originally used in Canada but has since been adopted by the International Organization for Standardization, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the United States) have shown a preference for the term geospatial technology, which may be defined as synonym of ""geospatial information and communications technology"".",1960,1971,1981,1982,2000,D,True,"The background knowledge provides information about the origin and history of the term 'geomatics'. It was first proposed in French in the late 1960s by scientist Bernard Dubuisson and was later adopted by various international authorities.

This publication defines technical geography with the following: ===Early 20th century=== In 1902, geodesy was suggested as a discipline supporting technical geography. Ultimately, the word choice is semantical, but the decision to use different terms for the same concept is one of many contributing factors to the term technical geography having less supporting literature than human or physical geography.

Which field of study was established based on the mathematical model of learning in the brain?,"Computational neuroscience focuses on the description of biologically plausible neurons (and neural systems) and their physiology and dynamics, and it is therefore not directly concerned with biologically unrealistic models used in connectionism, control theory, cybernetics, quantitative psychology, machine learning, artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence and computational learning theory; although mutual inspiration exists and sometimes there is no strict limit between fields, with model abstraction in computational neuroscience depending on research scope and the granularity at which biological entities are analyzed. Computational neuroscience (also known as theoretical neuroscience or mathematical neuroscience) is a branch of neuroscience which employs mathematical models, computer simulations, theoretical analysis and abstractions of the brain to understand the principles that govern the development, structure, physiology and cognitive abilities of the nervous system. These computational models frame hypotheses that can be directly tested by biological or psychological experiments. ==History== The term 'computational neuroscience' was introduced by Eric L. Schwartz, who organized a conference, held in 1985 in Carmel, California, at the request of the Systems Development Foundation to provide a summary of the current status of a field which until that point was referred to by a variety of names, such as neural modeling, brain theory and neural networks. Computational neuroscience provides a mathematical framework for studying the mechanisms involved in brain function and allows complete simulation and prediction of neuropsychological syndromes. ===Cognition, discrimination, and learning=== Computational modeling of higher cognitive functions has only recently begun.

The question is asking which government organizations require mandatory HACCP programs. The correct answer is A) FDA and USDA. Both organizations require mandatory HACCP programs for certain types of food products."
Why was HACCP developed?,"It is believed to stem from a production process monitoring used during World War II because traditional ""end of the pipe"" testing on artillery shells' firing mechanisms could not be performed, and a large percentage of the artillery shells made at the time were either duds or misfiring.MIL-STD-105 official record HACCP itself was conceived in the 1960s when the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) asked Pillsbury to design and manufacture the first foods for space flights. Since then, HACCP has been recognized internationally as a logical tool for adapting traditional inspection methods to a modern, science-based, food safety system. * Fresh-cut produce * Juice and nectar products * Food outlets * Meat and poultry products * School food and services ==Water quality management== The use of HACCP for water quality management was first proposed in 1994. HACCP is focused only on the health safety issues of a product and not the quality of the product, yet HACCP principles are the basis of most food quality and safety assurance systems. Over the period 1986 to 1990, a team consisting of National Sea Products and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans developed the first mandatory food inspection programme based on HACCP principles in the world.",To improve the quality of artillery shells in World War II,To design foods for space flights,To prevent food poisoning,To inspect finished products for hazards,To regulate food packaging and distribution,fail,False,fail
Who regulates HACCP systems for meat?,"Meat HACCP systems are regulated by the USDA, while seafood and juice are regulated by the FDA. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) require mandatory HACCP programs for juice and meat as an effective approach to food safety and protecting public health. In 1994, the organization International HACCP Alliance was established, initially to assist the US meat and poultry industries with implementing HACCP. All other food companies in the United States that are required to register with the FDA under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, as well as firms outside the US that export food to the US, are transitioning to mandatory hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls (HARPC) plans. In the UK the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) and Royal Society for Public Health offer HACCP for Food Manufacturing qualifications, accredited by the QCA (Qualifications and Curriculum Authority). ==Application== * Fish and fishery products Consequent to the promulgation of US Seafood Regulation on HACCP on 18th December 1995, it became mandatory that every processor exporting to USA to comply with HACCP with effect from 18.12.1997.",FDA,USDA,NASA,HARPC,Food companies,B,True,"Meat HACCP systems are regulated by the USDA, as stated in the background knowledge provided."

What is the goal of a formal ontology?,"In philosophy, the term formal ontology is used to refer to an ontology defined by axioms in a formal language with the goal to provide an unbiased (domain- and application-independent) view on reality, which can help the modeler of domain- or application-specific ontologies (information science) to avoid possibly erroneous ontological assumptions encountered in modeling large-scale ontologies. In information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. A formal ontology, on the other hand, represents entities without a particular application scope.

What is the purpose of designating military-use only airspaces?,"Military airspace is any area in which military aircraft are present and participate in a variety of activities. Restricted airspace is an area of airspace typically used by the military in which the local controlling authorities have determined that air traffic must be restricted or prohibited for safety or security concerns. In United States aviation, a National Security Area (NSA) is a designated airspace through which flight is discouraged for reasons of national security. However, pilots of aircraft are strongly encouraged to either stay clear of NSAs or obtain prior authorization to pass through them in order to reassure the controlling agency that no threat to national security exists.

Restricted airspace is an area of airspace typically used by the military in which the local controlling authorities have determined that air traffic must be restricted or prohibited for safety or security concerns. Violating prohibited airspace established for national security purposes may result in military interception and/or the possibility of an attack upon the violating aircraft, or if this is avoided then large fines and jail time are often incurred. A prohibited airspace is an area (volume) of airspace within which flight of aircraft is not allowed, usually due to security concerns. Notable ones include the Flight Restriction Zone (FRZ) encompassing all airspace up to within approximately of Ronald Reagan National Airport around Washington, D.C. Flights within this airspace, while not entirely prohibited, are highly restricted. ",Limited availability of military aircraft,Limited capacity for airmail services,Limited access to airspace for commercial purposes,Limited technology for air navigation,Limited funding for aviation research,C,True,"The background knowledge provides information about restricted and prohibited airspace due to safety and security concerns.

Which theory suggests that a participant's posture has an effect on their self-evaluation of their emotions?,"The main controversy surrounding these theories argues that emotions cannot happen without physiological arousal. == History == For the past several decades, appraisal theory has developed and evolved as a prominent theory in the field of communication and psychology by testing affect and emotion. Appraisal theories of emotion are theories that state that emotions result from people's interpretations and explanations of their circumstances even in the absence of physiological arousal (Aronson, 2005).Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., & Akert, R.M. (2005). Appraisal theory is the theory in psychology that emotions are extracted from our evaluations (appraisals or estimates) of events that cause specific reactions in different people. In other words, the theory suggests that researchers are able to examine an individual's appraisal of a situation and then predict the emotional experiences of that individual based upon his or her views of the situation.

"According to the research, what type of body movement is anger characterized by?","Anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally, cognitively, and physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force.Raymond DiGiuseppe, Raymond Chip Tafrate, Understanding Anger Disorders, Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 133–159. They relate to the direction of anger, its locus, reaction, modality, impulsivity, and objective. The external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions, body language, physiological responses, and at times public acts of aggression.

What is an oil spill?,"An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. Oil spills may be due to releases of crude oil from tankers, offshore platforms, drilling rigs and wells, as well as spills of refined petroleum products (such as gasoline and diesel fuel) and their by-products, heavier fuels used by large ships such as bunker fuel, or the spill of any oily refuse or waste oil. The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. Causes of oil spills are further distinguished between deliberate releases, such as operational discharges or acts of war and accidental releases. As a result, oil spill accidents have initiated intense media attention and political uproar, bringing many together in a political struggle concerning government response to oil spills and what actions can best prevent them from happening. ==Human impact== An oil spill represents an immediate negative effects on human health, including respiratory and reproductive problems as well as liver, and immune system damage. ",The release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment due to human activity,The release of gasoline and diesel fuel into the environment due to human activity,"The release of crude oil from tankers, offshore platforms, drilling rigs, and wells",The release of any oily refuse or waste oil into the environment,The release of oil into the atmosphere due to human activity,A,True,"Based on the background knowledge provided, an oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity. The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. Causes of oil spills are further distinguished between deliberate releases, such as operational discharges or acts of war and accidental releases. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Which ecosystem is most affected by oil spills?,"Such analysis can also be used to follow weathering and degradation of crude spills. ==Largest oil spills== Crude oil and refined fuel spills from tanker ship accidents have damaged vulnerable ecosystems in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, the Galapagos Islands, France, the Sundarbans, Ogoniland, and many other places. Oil tanker spills are considered a major ecological threat due to the large amount of oil spilled per accident and the fact that major sea traffic routes are close to Large Marine Ecosystems. There are varying types of coastal habitats and ecosystems and thus also many endangered species that need to be considered when looking at affected areas post oil spills. Oil spills, when they occur, are detrimental to the surrounding environment, humans, and native wildlife. The study found that cardiotoxicity might have been widespread in animal life exposed to the spill. ==Impact on beaches== thumb|350px|right|Workers cleaning up a beach during Deepwater Horizon oil spill The oil from the disaster affected between 622 and 1300 miles of the United States coastline around the Gulf of Mexico and has acutely catalyzed the erosion of land due to the oil having led to the death of most of the marsh vegetation (flora).",Forest ecosystems,Desert ecosystems,Marine ecosystems,Grassland ecosystems,Tundra ecosystems,C,True,"The background knowledge states that oil spills have damaged vulnerable ecosystems in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, the Galapagos Islands, France, the Sundarbans, Ogoniland, and many other places. It also mentions that major sea traffic routes are close to Large Marine Ecosystems. Therefore, it can be inferred that marine ecosystems are most affected by oil spills."

What are the consequences of oil spills on wildlife?,"Oil spills penetrate into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Oil penetrates into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing their insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Oil spills have a more drastic impact in the late winter and early spring months, because large populations of overwintering birds gather near shores. However, marine species are more likely to be impacted by an oil spill. === Birds === Of the many species affected by direct exposure to oil, birds are usually the most severely affected. The species of bird and the type of oil can vary the effects of oil exposure. ",Increased buoyancy in the water,Improved insulating ability of plumage and fur,Reduced vulnerability to temperature fluctuations,Damage to liver and immune system,None of the above,D,True,"Oil spills can penetrate into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing their insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Birds are usually the most severely affected by direct exposure to oil. Therefore, option E can be eliminated. Option A is incorrect because oil spills reduce buoyancy in the water. Option B and C are also incorrect because oil spills reduce the insulating ability of plumage and fur, and increase vulnerability to temperature fluctuations. Option D is partially correct because oil spills can damage the liver and immune system of wildlife, but it is not the only consequence. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Damage to liver and immune system."
What factors affect the cleanup and recovery from an oil spill?,"Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Cleanup costs are impacted by numerous factors such as location of the spill, type of oil spilled, surrounding sensitive areas, and local regulations. The differing substrates between shoreline types vary in their response to oiling, and influence the type of cleanup that will be required to effectively decontaminate the shoreline. Oil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin oil slick which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. ",Type of oil spilled,Temperature of the water,Type of shorelines and beaches involved,All of the above,None of the above,D,True,"The background knowledge clearly states that cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water, and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Therefore, the answer is D) All of the above."
