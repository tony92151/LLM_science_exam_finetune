Spacetime symmetries are features of spacetime that can be described as exhibiting some form of symmetry. See Section 10.1 for a definition of symmetries. Symmetries usually require some form of preserving property, the most important of which in general relativity include the following: *preserving geodesics of the spacetime *preserving the metric tensor *preserving the curvature tensor These and other symmetries will be discussed below in more detail. Spacetime symmetries are distinguished from internal symmetries. ==Physical motivation== Physical problems are often investigated and solved by noticing features which have some form of symmetry.",Symmetries describe features of spacetime that are changed under some transformation.,Symmetries describe features of particles that are unchanged under some transformation.,Symmetries describe features of particles that are changed under some transformation.,Symmetries describe features of spacetime that are unchanged under some transformation.,Symmetries describe features of particles that are irrelevant under some transformation.,D,TRUE,"The background knowledge provides a clear definition of symmetries in quantum mechanics.

"What are symmetry, invariance, and conservation laws in physics?","In general, symmetry in physics, invariance, and conservation laws, are fundamentally important constraints for formulating physical theories and models. In general, by Noether's theorem, any invariance of a physical system under a continuous symmetry leads to a fundamental conservation law. Invariance is an important concept in modern theoretical physics, and many theories are expressed in terms of their symmetries and invariants. ==Examples== In classical and quantum mechanics, invariance of space under translation results in momentum being an invariant and the conservation of momentum, whereas invariance of the origin of time, i.e. translation in time, results in energy being an invariant and the conservation of energy. Covariance and contravariance generalize the mathematical properties of invariance in tensor mathematics, and are frequently used in electromagnetism, special relativity, and general relativity. == See also == * Casimir operator * Charge (physics) * Conservation law * Conserved quantity * General covariance * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors * Invariants of tensors * Killing form * Physical constant * Scalar (physics) * Symmetry (physics) * Uniformity of nature * Weyl transformation == References == Category:Conservation laws Category:Physical quantities Invariance, as a broader term, also applies to the no change of form of physical laws under a transformation, and is closer in scope to the mathematical definition.

They play a crucial role in modern theoretical physics and are used to express and understand the behavior of physical systems. Therefore, option A) They are fundamental constraints for formulating physical theories and models is the correct answer."
How do conservation laws contribute to solving problems in physics?,"Symmetries and conservation laws: Consequences of Noether’s theorem. The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the laws of physics do not change with time itself. In physics, charge conservation is the principle that the total electric charge in an isolated system never changes. The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy, the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as the system's mass cannot change, so the quantity can neither be added nor be removed. ",They directly provide the answer to the problem.,They are the correct constraints and the first steps to solving a multitude of problems.,They are irrelevant in the formulation of physical theories and models.,"They are only useful in classical physics, not quantum mechanics.",They hinder problem-solving in physics.,B,TRUE,"Conservation laws play a crucial role in solving problems in physics. They are the correct constraints and the first steps to solving a multitude of problems. Conservation laws provide important information about the behavior of physical systems and can be used to derive equations and relationships that help solve problems. Therefore, option B) is the correct answer."
What do Lie groups and relativistic transformations relate to in quantum mechanics?,"* Category:Representation theory of Lie groups Category:Special relativity Category:Quantum mechanics In mathematics, Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence allows one to correspond a Lie group to a Lie algebra or vice versa, and study the conditions for such a relationship. The action of the Lorentz group on the space of field configurations (a field configuration is the spacetime history of a particular solution, e.g. the electromagnetic field in all of space over all time is one field configuration) resembles the action on the Hilbert spaces of quantum mechanics, except that the commutator brackets are replaced by field theoretical Poisson brackets. === Relativistic quantum mechanics === For the present purposes the following definition is made: A relativistic wave function is a set of functions on spacetime which transforms under an arbitrary proper Lorentz transformation as \psi'^\alpha(x) = D{[\Lambda]^\alpha}_\beta \psi^\beta \left(\Lambda^{-1} x\right), where is an -dimensional matrix representative of belonging to some direct sum of the representations to be introduced below. See representation of Lie algebras for the Lie algebra theory. ==An example: The rotation group SO(3)== In quantum mechanics, the time-independent Schrödinger equation, \hat{H}\psi=E\psi plays an important role. For example, if G is the Lie group of invertible real square matrices of size n (general linear group), then \operatorname{Lie}(G) is the Lie algebra of real square matrices of size n and \exp(X) = e^X = \sum_0^\infty {X^j / j!}. == The correspondence == The correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras includes the following three main results.",They relate to the mathematical formulation of the standard model.,They relate to the condensed matter physics.,They relate to the classical form of continuous symmetries.,They relate to the quantum operators of symmetries.,They relate to the mathematical formulation of quantum field theory.,D,TRUE,"The background knowledge mentions the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras, as well as the action of the Lorentz group on the Hilbert spaces of quantum mechanics.

What is the main purpose of statistical mechanics?,"Statistical mechanics arose out of the development of classical thermodynamics, a field for which it was successful in explaining macroscopic physical properties—such as temperature, pressure, and heat capacity—in terms of microscopic parameters that fluctuate about average values and are characterized by probability distributions. In physics, statistical mechanics is a mathematical framework that applies statistical methods and probability theory to large assemblies of microscopic entities. In other words, statistical thermodynamics provides a connection between the macroscopic properties of materials in thermodynamic equilibrium, and the microscopic behaviours and motions occurring inside the material.

Who developed the fundamental interpretation of entropy?,"These concepts were further developed by James Clerk Maxwell [1871] and Max Planck [1903]. ==Statistical thermodynamic views== In 1877, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a statistical mechanical evaluation of the entropy , of a body in its own given macrostate of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. The concept entropy was first developed by German physicist Rudolf Clausius in the mid-nineteenth century as a thermodynamic property that predicts that certain spontaneous processes are irreversible or impossible. The statistical entropy perspective was introduced in 1870 by Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, who established a new field of physics that provided the descriptive linkage between the macroscopic observation of nature and the microscopic view based on the rigorous treatment of large ensembles of microstates that constitute thermodynamic systems. ==Boltzmann's principle== Ludwig Boltzmann defined entropy as a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, consistent with its macroscopic thermodynamic properties, which constitute the macrostate of the system. The mathematical expressions for thermodynamic entropy in the statistical thermodynamics formulation established by Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs in the 1870s are similar to the information entropy by Claude Shannon and Ralph Hartley, developed in the 1940s. ==Equivalence of form of the defining expressions== The defining expression for entropy in the theory of statistical mechanics established by Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs in the 1870s, is of the form: : S = - k_\text{B} \sum_i p_i \ln p_i , where p_i is the probability of the microstate i taken from an equilibrium ensemble.

What did Ludwig Boltzmann develop in terms of entropy?,"The statistical entropy perspective was introduced in 1870 by Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, who established a new field of physics that provided the descriptive linkage between the macroscopic observation of nature and the microscopic view based on the rigorous treatment of large ensembles of microstates that constitute thermodynamic systems. ==Boltzmann's principle== Ludwig Boltzmann defined entropy as a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, consistent with its macroscopic thermodynamic properties, which constitute the macrostate of the system. Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics and the Boltzmann distribution remain central in the foundations of classical statistical mechanics. Boltzmann formulated a simple relationship between entropy and the number of possible microstates of a system, which is denoted by the symbol Ω. In thermodynamics, the interpretation of entropy as a measure of energy dispersal has been exercised against the background of the traditional view, introduced by Ludwig Boltzmann, of entropy as a quantitative measure of disorder. Boltzmann's principle is regarded as the foundation of statistical mechanics. == Gibbs entropy formula== The macroscopic state of a system is characterized by a distribution on the microstates.",A collection of microstates,Models of probability distribution,The foundations of statistical mechanics,The kinetic theory of gases,The Maxwell distribution of molecular velocities,A,FALSE,fail

What is entropy?,"Entropy is a scientific concept, as well as a measurable physical property, that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of ""disorder"" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). In classical thermodynamics, entropy () is a property of a thermodynamic system that expresses the direction or outcome of spontaneous changes in the system. In statistical mechanics, entropy is formulated as a statistical property using probability theory. The traditional qualitative description of entropy is that it refers to changes in the status quo of the system and is a measure of ""molecular disorder"" and the amount of wasted energy in a dynamical energy transformation from one state or form to another.

Who first recognized the concept of entropy?,"The concept entropy was first developed by German physicist Rudolf Clausius in the mid-nineteenth century as a thermodynamic property that predicts that certain spontaneous processes are irreversible or impossible. Building on this logic, and following a mathematical presentation of the first fundamental theorem, Clausius then presented the first-ever mathematical formulation of entropy, although at this point in the development of his theories he called it ""equivalence-value"", perhaps referring to the concept of the mechanical equivalent of heat which was developing at the time rather than entropy, a term which was to come into use later.Mechanical Theory of Heat, by Rudolf Clausius, 1850-1865 He stated:Published in Poggendoff's Annalen, December 1854, vol. xciii. p. 481; translated in the Journal de Mathematiques, vol. xx. Paris, 1855, and in the Philosophical Magazine, August 1856, s. Clausius continued to develop his ideas of lost energy, and coined the term entropy. These concepts were further developed by James Clerk Maxwell [1871] and Max Planck [1903]. ==Statistical thermodynamic views== In 1877, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a statistical mechanical evaluation of the entropy , of a body in its own given macrostate of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. This equivalence-value was a precursory formulation of entropy.Clausius, Rudolf. (1856).",William Rankine,Rudolf Clausius,Scottish scientist and engineer,German physicist,Both A and B,E,FALSE,fail

What does the second law of thermodynamics state?,"The second law may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium where the entropy is highest at the given internal energy. For isolated systems, no energy is provided by the surroundings and the second law requires that the entropy of the system alone must increase: ΔS > 0. The second law of thermodynamics in other versions establishes the concept of entropy as a physical property of a thermodynamic system. In terms of time variation, the mathematical statement of the second law for an isolated system undergoing an arbitrary transformation is: : \frac{dS}{dt} \ge 0 where : S is the entropy of the system and : t is time. They do not offer it as a full statement of the second law: ::... there is only one way in which the entropy of a [closed] system can be decreased, and that is to transfer heat from the system.Borgnakke, C., Sonntag., R.E.

Crocco's Multiplanetary Trajectory, sometimes named Crocco's Mission and Crocco's ""Grand Tour"", is a mathematical description of an hypothetical Earth- Mars-Venus-Earth-Research Mission, which was first proposed in 1956 by the Aeronautics and Space Pioneer G. A. Crocco during the VII. Crocco realized that the flight trajectory may be disrupted by the gravitational fields of Mars and Venus, delaying or ultimately preventing return to Earth. Crocco proposed the first Mission to be launched in June 1971. == Difference between Crocco's Mission and Gravity Assists == Crocco was well aware of the planet's gravitational effects, but his mission profile is neither using them to accelerate nor decelerate, instead limiting itself to utilizing them for trajectory stabilizations.Gaetano Arturo Crocco: One-Year Exploration-Trip Earth-Mars- Venus-Earth.

What is quantum state discrimination?,"The term quantum state discrimination collectively refers to quantum- informatics techniques, with the help of which, by performing a small number of measurements on a physical system , its specific quantum state can be identified . This is an alternative discrimination strategy that is not in general optimal, but can still be shown to work pretty well. == References == == External links == * Interactive demonstration about quantum state discrimination Category:Quantum information science Category:Quantum information theory Category:Quantum measurement Category:Quantum computing In quantum physics, a quantum state is a mathematical entity that embodies the knowledge of a quantum system. Quantum mechanics specifies the construction, evolution, and measurement of a quantum state. For example, the quantum state of an electron in a double-slit experiment could consist complex values over the detection region and, when squared, only predict the probability distribution of electron counts across the detector. == Categories of quantum states == Quantum states may be defined in different ways for different kinds of systems or problems. ",A technique to identify the specific quantum state of a system,A method to measure multiple quantum states simultaneously,A process to create orthogonal vectors in a quantum system,A way to determine the state of a system without additional measurements,A technique used in quantum tomography,A,TRUE,"The background knowledge clearly defines quantum state discrimination as a technique to identify the specific quantum state of a system. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
What distinguishes quantum state discrimination from quantum tomography?,"Quantum tomography or quantum state tomography is the process by which a quantum state is reconstructed using measurements on an ensemble of identical quantum states.Quantum State Tomography. Unlike a measurement on a single system, which determines the system's current state after the measurement (in general, the act of making a measurement alters the quantum state), quantum tomography works to determine the state(s) prior to the measurements. Also known as ""quantum estimation"", tomography techniques are increasingly important including those for quantum measurement tomography and the very similar quantum state tomography. Quantum state tomography is a method to determine all these parameters from a series of measurements on many independent and identically prepared systems. The term quantum state discrimination collectively refers to quantum- informatics techniques, with the help of which, by performing a small number of measurements on a physical system , its specific quantum state can be identified .

What is required in order to unambiguously determine the state of a system with orthogonal vectors?,"In linear algebra, orthogonalization is the process of finding a set of orthogonal vectors that span a particular subspace. Formally, starting with a linearly independent set of vectors {v1, ... , vk} in an inner product space (most commonly the Euclidean space Rn), orthogonalization results in a set of orthogonal vectors {u1, ... , uk} that generate the same subspace as the vectors v1, ... , vk. This definition can be formalized in Cartesian space by defining the dot product and specifying that two vectors in the plane are orthogonal if their dot product is zero. In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, an orthogonal basis for an inner product space V is a basis for V whose vectors are mutually orthogonal. It has a wide range of applications in many signals processing and seismic exploration fields. ==See also== *Orthogonality *Biorthogonal system *Orthogonal basis == References == Category:Linear algebra",Performing multiple quantum measurements,Knowing the set of states in advance,Using quantum tomography techniques,Creating a quantum measurement basis,None of the above,B,FALSE,fail
What happens when individual quantum states are not orthogonal to each other?,"In quantum information theory, quantum state merging is the transfer of a quantum state when the receiver already has part of the state. It is true that for any pure entangled state there exists a choice of measurements that produce Bell nonlocal correlations, but the situation is more complex for mixed states. It seems, therefore, that, even when the above principles are taken together, they do not suffice to single out the quantum set in the simplest Bell scenario of two parties, two inputs and two outputs. ==Device independent protocols== Nonlocality can be exploited to conduct quantum information tasks which do not rely on the knowledge of the inner workings of the prepare-and-measurement apparatuses involved in the experiment. In theoretical physics, quantum nonlocality refers to the phenomenon by which the measurement statistics of a multipartite quantum system do not admit an interpretation in terms of a local realistic theory.

This is known as the no-cloning theorem. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
When is it necessary to consider incorrect or inconclusive determination of the system state?,"No consistent or quantitative definition of a ""failed state"" exists; the subjective nature of the indicators that are used to infer state failure have led to an ambiguous understanding of the term. The conclusion that a state is failing or has failed can be drawn from the observation of a variety of characteristics and combinations thereof. Call does not necessarily suggest that states that suffer from the challenges of the three gaps should be identified as failed states but instead presents the framework as an alternative to the state failure concept as a whole. These cases are not branded 'failed states. == Measurement == The measurement methods of state failure are generally divided into the quantitative and qualitative approach. ===Quantitative approach=== Quantitative measurement of state failure means the creation of indexes and rankings are particularly important. Olivier Nay, William Easterly, and Laura Freschi have critiqued the concept of state failure as not having a coherent definition, with indices combining various indicators of state performance arbitrarily weighted to arrive at unclear and aggregated measurements of state fragility.Nay Olivier.

What is a persistence module?,"A persistence module often consists of a collection of homology groups (or vector spaces if using field coefficients) corresponding to a filtration of topological spaces, and a collection of linear maps induced by the inclusions of the filtration. A persistence module is a mathematical structure in persistent homology and topological data analysis that formally captures the persistence of topological features of an object across a range of scale parameters. Homology modules are the most ubiquitous examples of persistence modules, as they encode information about the number and scale of topological features of an object (usually derived from building a filtration on a point cloud) in a purely algebraic structure, thus making understanding the shape of the data amenable to algebraic techniques, imported from well-developed areas of mathematics such as commutative algebra and representation theory. === Interval Modules === A primary concern in the study of persistence modules is whether modules can be decomposed into ""simpler pieces"", roughly speaking. A persistence module indexed by a discrete poset such as the integers can be represented intuitively as a diagram of spaces: \cdots \to M_{-1} \to M_0 \to M_1 \to M_2 \to \cdots To emphasize the indexing set being used, a persistence module indexed by P is sometimes called a P-persistence module, or simply a P-module.

A persistence module often consists of a collection of homology groups (or vector spaces if using field coefficients) corresponding to a filtration of topological spaces, and a collection of linear maps induced by the inclusions of the filtration.

Define a persistence module Q(I) via Q(I_s)= \begin{cases} 0, & \text{if } s otin I;\\\ \mathbb F, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}, where the linear maps are the identity map inside the interval.

One can alternatively use a set- theoretic definition of a persistence module that is equivalent to the categorical viewpoint: A persistence module is a pair (V,\pi) where V is a collection \\{V_z\\}_{z\in P} of K -vector spaces and \pi is a collection \\{\pi_{y,z}\\}_{y\leq z\in P} of linear maps where \pi_{y,z} : V_y \to V_z for each y\leq z \in P , such that \pi_{y,z} \circ \pi_{x,y} = \pi_{x,z} for any x \leq y \leq z \in P (i.e., all the maps commute). === Multiparameter Persistence Modules === In the case of a P-module M where P is a single partially ordered set (e.g., \mathbb R, \mathbb Z, \mathbb N, etc.), we say that M is a single- or 1-parameter persistence module.","φs,t ∘ φr,s = φr,t","φs,t + φr,s = φr,t","φs,t * φr,s = φr,t","φs,t / φr,s = φr,t",None of the above,A,TRUE,"The background knowledge defines a persistence module as a family of vector spaces and linear maps that satisfy the equation φs,t ∘ φr,s = φr,t for all r ≤ s ≤ t.

This is equivalent to the definition above, and may be used as an alternative definition of the absolute value of real numbers. When x itself is negative then its absolute value is necessarily positive From an analytic geometry point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's distance from zero along the real number line, and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers (their absolute difference) is the distance between them. This generalizes the alternative definition for reals: The complex absolute value shares the four fundamental properties given above for the real absolute value.

The two primary types of marine heat exchangers used aboard vessels in the maritime industry are plate, and shell and tube. This has a major advantage over a conventional heat exchanger in that the fluids are exposed to a much larger surface area because the fluids are spread out over the plates. Thus to design plate heat exchangers, one should consider both factors. A plate-fin heat exchanger is a type of heat exchanger design that uses plates and finned chambers to transfer heat between fluids, most commonly gases.

At cryogenic (very low) temperatures around 20 K, the specific heat of metals is low, and so a regenerator must be larger for a given heat load. == Advantages of regenerators == The advantages of a regenerator over a recuperating (counter-flowing) heat exchanger is that it has a much higher surface area for a given volume, which provides a reduced exchanger volume for a given energy density, effectiveness and pressure drop. A regenerative heat exchanger, or more commonly a regenerator, is a type of heat exchanger where heat from the hot fluid is intermittently stored in a thermal storage medium before it is transferred to the cold fluid. The heat transfer coefficient is much lower for gases than for liquids, thus the enormous surface area in a regenerator greatly increases heat transfer. == Disadvantages of regenerators == The major disadvantage of rotary and fixed- matrix regenerators is that there is always some mixing of the fluid streams, and they can not be completely separated.",To increase their efficiency,To prevent fouling and galvanic corrosion,To improve their cooling capacity,To reduce their footprint,To make them compatible with non-marine applications,B,FALSE,fail
What determines the passageways for fluid flow in plate-type marine heat exchangers?,"The plates are designed in such a way that when placed next to each other they create passageways to the fluid to flow between the plates. In the corrugated plate heat exchangers, because of narrow path between the plates, there is a large pressure capacity and the flow becomes turbulent along the path. The plates are pressed to form troughs at right angles to the direction of flow of the liquid which runs through the channels in the heat exchanger. A layout configuration of plate heat exchanger can be usually simplified into a manifold system with two manifold headers for dividing and combining fluids, which can be categorized into U-type and Z-type arrangement according to flow direction in the headers, as shown in manifold arrangement. The plate geometry is one of the most important factor in heat transfer and pressure drop in plate heat exchangers, however such a feature is not accurately prescribed.

What is the role of gauge bosons in particle physics?,"In particle physics, a gauge boson is a bosonic elementary particle that acts as the force carrier for elementary fermions.

Photons, W and Z bosons, and gluons are gauge bosons. Consequently, there are as many gauge bosons as there are generators of the gauge field.

The differential is defined in modern treatments of differential calculus as follows.See, for instance, the influential treatises of , , , and . This yields yet another refinement of the notion of differential: that it should be a linear function of a kinematic velocity. Likewise, in differential geometry, the differential of a function at a point is a linear function of a tangent vector (an ""infinitely small displacement""), which exhibits it as a kind of one-form: the exterior derivative of the function. In mathematics, differential of the first kind is a traditional term used in the theories of Riemann surfaces (more generally, complex manifolds) and algebraic curves (more generally, algebraic varieties), for everywhere-regular differential 1-forms.",The derivatives of functions,Infinitesimal differences,The concept of infinitely small changes,The linearization of a function,The generalization for functions of multiple variables,C,TRUE,"The background knowledge provides a clear definition of the term 'differential' in mathematics.

Which branches of mathematics use the term differential?,"In mathematics, differential algebra is, broadly speaking, the area of mathematics consisting in the study of differential equations and differential operators as algebraic objects in view of deriving properties of differential equations and operators without computing the solutions, similarly as polynomial algebras are used for the study of algebraic varieties, which are solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. Many of these concepts are widely used in algebraic geometry, differential geometry and secondary calculus. In mathematics the differential calculus over commutative algebras is a part of commutative algebra based on the observation that most concepts known from classical differential calculus can be formulated in purely algebraic terms. In mathematics, differential of the first kind is a traditional term used in the theories of Riemann surfaces (more generally, complex manifolds) and algebraic curves (more generally, algebraic varieties), for everywhere-regular differential 1-forms.

How is the differential dx defined in calculus?,"Since dx(x,\Delta x)=\Delta x, it is conventional to write dx=\Delta x so that the following equality holds: df(x) = f'(x) \, dx This notion of differential is broadly applicable when a linear approximation to a function is sought, in which the value of the increment \Delta x is small enough. In calculus, the differential represents the principal part of the change in a function y = f(x) with respect to changes in the independent variable. The differential dy is defined by dy = f'(x)\,dx, where f'(x) is the derivative of with respect to x, and dx is an additional real variable (so that dy is a function of x and dx). Traditionally, the variables dx and dy are considered to be very small (infinitesimal), and this interpretation is made rigorous in non- standard analysis. ==History and usage== The differential was first introduced via an intuitive or heuristic definition by Isaac Newton and furthered by Gottfried Leibniz, who thought of the differential as an infinitely small (or infinitesimal) change in the value of the function, corresponding to an infinitely small change in the function's argument . This leads directly to the notion that the differential of a function at a point is a linear functional of an increment \Delta x.

What does the formula dy/dx represent?,"In physics, the differential coefficient of a function f(x) is what is now called its derivative df(x)/dx, the (not necessarily constant) multiplicative factor or coefficient of the differential dx in the differential df(x). When f is not linear, its differential coefficient is a function, call it f′, derived by the differentiation of f, hence, the modern term, derivative. A coefficient is usually a constant quantity, but the differential coefficient of f is a constant function only if f is a linear function. In his 1998 update of this text, Martin Gardner lets the first use of ""differential coefficient"" stand, along with Thompson's criticism of the term as a needlessly obscure phrase that should not intimidate students, and substitutes ""derivative"" for the remainder of the book.

How can an ionized plasma be efficiently produced or heated?,"In plasma physics, a burning plasma is one in which most of the heating comes from fusion reactions involving thermal plasma ions. The high temperatures needed to sustain fusion reactions are maintained by a self-heating process in which energy from the fusion reaction heats the thermal plasma ions via particle collisions. To reach fusion-relevant temperatures, the ITER tokamak will heat plasmas using three methods: ohmic heating (running electric current through the plasma), neutral particle beam injection, and high-frequency electromagnetic radiation. Issues to be explored include understanding and controlling a strongly coupled, self-organized plasma; management of heat and particles that reach plasma-facing surfaces; demonstration of fuel breeding technology; and the physics of energetic particles. A plasma enters what scientists call the burning plasma regime when the self- heating power exceeds any external heating.

One of the methods is high-frequency electromagnetic radiation. The background knowledge also mentions that a plasma enters the burning plasma regime when the self-heating power exceeds any external heating. Therefore, option A seems to be the most efficient way to produce or heat an ionized plasma as it involves high-frequency electromagnetic radiation at the electron cyclotron resonance frequency, which is the frequency that can efficiently heat the plasma ions."
"In magnetic fusion energy research, how can the location of power deposition be controlled?","Magnetic confinement fusion is an approach to generate thermonuclear fusion power that uses magnetic fields to confine fusion fuel in the form of a plasma.

Circuit breaker detects failures and prevents the application from trying to perform the action that is doomed to fail (until it's safe to retry). ==Implementation== Implementations of the Circuit Breaker Design Pattern need to retain the state of the connection over a series of requests. ,A type of switch,A device that generates electricity,A device that amplifies the electric current,A device that stores electricity,A device that measures temperature,A,TRUE,"Based on the provided background knowledge, a circuit breaker is a design pattern used in software development that detects failures and prevents the application from trying to perform the action that is doomed to fail (until it's safe to retry). It is not a physical device that generates, amplifies, or stores electricity, nor does it measure temperature. However, a circuit breaker can also refer to a physical device that is used to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current from an overload or short circuit, which is a type of switch. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

What is the term used to describe an enzyme that catalyses a reaction so efficiently that the rate limiting step is that of substrate diffusion into the active site or product diffusion out?,"A diffusion-limited enzyme catalyses a reaction so efficiently that the rate limiting step is that of substrate diffusion into the active site, or product diffusion out. The rate of the enzyme-catalysed reaction is limited by diffusion and so the enzyme 'processes' the substrate well before it encounters another molecule.

The description of tensor fields and operations on them in terms of their components is the focus of the Ricci calculus. Expressions in the notation of the Ricci calculus may generally be interpreted as a set of simultaneous equations relating the components as functions over a manifold, usually more specifically as functions of the coordinates on the manifold.

The graph shows two ways to obtain 4 liters using 3-liter and 5-liter jugs, and a water source and sink on a Cartesian grid with diagonal lines of slope −1 (such that x+y=const. on these diagonal lines, which represent pouring water from one jug to the other jug). Water pouring puzzles (also called water jug problems, decanting problems, measuring puzzles, or Die Hard with a Vengeance puzzles) are a class of puzzle involving a finite collection of water jugs of known integer capacities (in terms of a liquid measure such as liters or gallons). Puzzles of this type ask how many steps of pouring water from one jug to another (until either one jug becomes empty or the other becomes full) are needed to reach a goal state, specified in terms of the volume of liquid that must be present in some jug or jugs. For example, if one jug that holds 8 liters is empty and the other jug that hold 12 liters has 9 liters of water in it to begin with, then with a source (tap) and a drain (sink), these two jugs can measure volumes of 9 liters, 5 liters, 1 liter, as well as 12 liters, 8 liters, 4 liters and 0 liters.","Three jugs with capacities 6, 4, and 2 liters","Three jugs with capacities 10, 7, and 5 liters","Three jugs with capacities 8, 5, and 3 liters","Three jugs with capacities 12, 9, and 6 liters","Three jugs with capacities 15, 12, and 9 liters",C,TRUE,"The background knowledge mentions that the standard puzzle of this kind works with three jugs of capacity 8, 5 and 3 liters."

Therefore, there are only two solutions to the problem: :(5, 0) ↔ (0, 5) ↔ (12, 5) ↔ (9, 8) ↔ (9, 0) :(5, 0) ↔ (5, 8) ↔ (12, 1) ↔ (0, 1) ↔ (1, 0) ↔ (1, 8) ↔ (9, 0) For the 4 liter question, since 4\equiv 0 \\! \mod \\!4, one irreversible action is necessary at the start of the solution; It could be simply pouring the whole 9 liters of water from the 12-liter jug to the sink (0,0), or fully fill it to 12 liters from the tap (12,0).

Therefore, we can solve the problem by pouring water from the 8-liter jug to the 5-liter jug and then from the 5-liter jug to the 3-liter jug. This takes 2 steps. Then, we can pour the water from the 3-liter jug to the 8-liter jug, fill the 3-liter jug again, pour water from the 3-liter jug to the 8-liter jug until the 8-liter jug is full, and then pour the remaining water from the 3-liter jug to the 5-liter jug. This takes 5 more steps. Therefore, the total number of steps needed to solve the standard water pouring puzzle example is 7 steps."
Which actions in water pouring puzzles are reversible?,"Again, if we restrict ourselves to reversible actions only, from the desired point (5,0), there are only two reversible actions: transferring 5 liter of water from the 12-liter jug to the 8-liter jug (0,5), or filling the empty 8 liter jug to full from the tap (5,8). The puzzle may be solved in seven steps, passing through the following sequence of states (denoted as a bracketed triple of the three volumes of water in the three jugs): :[8,0,0] → [3,5,0] → [3,2,3] → [6,2,0] → [6,0,2] → [1,5,2] → [1,4,3] → [4,4,0]. writes that this particular puzzle ""dates back to mediaeval times"" and notes its occurrence in Bachet's 17th-century mathematics textbook. == Reversibility of actions == Since the rules only allows stopping/turning on the boundaries of the Cartesian grid (i.e. at the full capacities of each jug), the only reversible actions (reversible in one step) are: * Transferring water from a full jug to any jug * Transferring water from any jug to an empty jug The only irreversible actions that can't be reversed in one step are: * Transferring water from a partially full jug to another partially full jug By restricting ourselves to reversible actions only, we can construct the solution to the problem from the desired result. From the point (4, 0), there are only two reversible actions: filling the empty 3-liter jug to full from the tap (4,3), or transferring 1 liter of water from the 5-liter jug to the 3-liter jug (1,3). From the point [4,4,0], there are only two reversible action: Transferring 3 liters from the 8 liter jug to the empty 3 liter jug [1,4,3], or transferring 3 liters from the 5 liter jug to the empty 3 liter jug [4,1,3].

What can be described in terms of adeles for a reductive group G?,"The structure theory of reductive groups is used in all these areas. ==Definitions== A linear algebraic group over a field k is defined as a smooth closed subgroup scheme of GL(n) over k, for some positive integer n.

In mathematics, the adele ring of a global field (also adelic ring, ring of adeles or ring of adèles) is a central object of class field theory, a branch of algebraic number theory. The ring of adeles allows one to describe the Artin reciprocity law, which is a generalisation of quadratic reciprocity, and other reciprocity laws over finite fields.

What is the shape of a pistol boiler firebox?,"It consists of a cylindrical horizontal shell with a cylindrical furnace and fire-tubes within this.

Which nutrient is commonly used in ocean fertilization experiments?,"As oceanic phosphorus is depleted (via sequestration) it would have to be included in the fertilization cocktail supplied from terrestrial sources. == Approaches == ""Ocean fertilisation options are only worthwhile if sustained on a millennial timescale and phosphorus addition may have greater long-term potential than iron or nitrogen fertilisation."" A number of techniques, including fertilization by the micronutrient iron (called iron fertilization) or with nitrogen and phosphorus (both macronutrients), have been proposed. Ocean nutrient fertilization, for example iron fertilization, could stimulate photosynthesis in phytoplankton. Research on this area has suggested that fertilization through deposition of large quantities of iron-rich dust into the ocean floor can significantly disrupt the ocean's nutrient balance and cause major complications in the food chain for other marine organisms. ==Methods== There are two ways of performing artificial iron fertilization: ship based direct into the ocean and atmospheric deployment. ===Ship based deployment=== Trials of ocean fertilization using iron sulphate added directly to the surface water from ships are described in detail in the experiment section below. ===Atmospheric sourcing=== Iron-rich dust rising into the atmosphere is a primary source of ocean iron fertilization.

Iron fertilization is the intentional introduction of iron to iron-poor areas of the ocean surface to stimulate phytoplankton production. Fertilization increases phytoplankton only in the open oceans (far from shore) where iron deficiency is substantial. Iron fertilization attempts to encourage phytoplankton growth, which removes carbon from the atmosphere for at least a period of time.

What is one of the risks associated with nutrient fertilization?,"Atmospheric deposition (e.g., in the form of acid rain) can also affect nutrient concentration in water, especially in highly industrialized regions. == Impacts == === Environmental and economic impacts === Excess nutrients have been summarized as potentially leading to: * Excess growth of algae (harmful algal blooms); and biodiversity loss; * Species composition shifts (dominant taxa); * Food web changes, light limitation; * Excess organic carbon (eutrophication); dissolved oxygen deficits (environmental hypoxia); toxin production; Nutrient pollution can have economic impacts due to increasing water treatment costs, commercial fishing and shellfish losses, recreational fishing losses, and reduced tourism income. === Health impacts === Human health effects include excess nitrate in drinking water (blue baby syndrome) and disinfection by-products in drinking water. These nutrients can eventually end up in aquatic ecosystems and are a contributor to increased eutrophication. For many coastal water bodies, the main pollutant issue is excess nutrients, also termed nutrient over-enrichment. In order to gauge how to best prevent eutrophication from occurring, specific sources that contribute to nutrient loading must be identified. It is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters (lakes, rivers and coastal waters), in which excess nutrients, usually nitrogen or phosphorus, stimulate algal growth.

What is specific impulse?,"Specific impulse (usually abbreviated ) is a measure of how efficiently a reaction mass engine (a rocket using propellant or a jet engine using fuel) creates thrust. In other words, given a particular engine and a mass of a particular propellant, specific impulse measures for how long a time that engine can exert a continuous force (thrust) until fully burning that mass of propellant. Specific impulse measures the impulse produced per unit of propellant and is proportional to the exhaust velocity. In an atmospheric context, specific impulse can include the contribution to impulse provided by the mass of external air that is accelerated by the engine in some way, such as by an internal turbofan or heating by fuel combustion participation then thrust expansion or by external propeller.

How does a propulsion system with a higher specific impulse use propellant more efficiently?,"A propulsion system with a higher specific impulse uses the mass of the propellant more efficiently. The higher the specific impulse, the less propellant is needed to produce a given thrust for a given time and the more efficient the propellant is. This should not be confused with the physics concept of energy efficiency, which can decrease as specific impulse increases, since propulsion systems that give high specific impulse require high energy to do so. For engines whose reaction mass is only the fuel they carry, specific impulse is exactly proportional to the effective exhaust gas velocity. By computing the exhaust velocity from the equation for thrust (while still assuming \dot{m}_{exh} = \dot{m}_{in}= \dot{m}), we can also obtain the propulsive efficiency as a function of specific thrust (T / \dot{m}): :\eta_p = \frac{v_0}{v_0 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{T}{\dot{m}}} A corollary of this is that, particularly in air breathing engines, it is more energy efficient to accelerate a large amount of air by a small amount, than it is to accelerate a small amount of air by a large amount, even though the thrust is the same.",By requiring less propellant for a given delta-v,By increasing the actual exhaust velocity of the engine,By decreasing the specific fuel consumption of the system,By accelerating external air in addition to the reaction mass,By using a combination of rocket and jet engines,A,FALSE,fail

The propellant mass fraction is the ratio of just the propellant to the entire mass of the vehicle at takeoff (propellant plus dry mass). In other words, the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle. In aerospace engineering, the propellant mass fraction is the portion of a vehicle's mass which does not reach the destination, usually used as a measure of the vehicle's performance.

This formulation, known as categorical quantum mechanics, allows, in turn, a connection to be made from quantum mechanics to linear logic as the logic of quantum information theory (in the same sense that intuitionistic logic arises from Cartesian closed categories). == History == According to Asher Peresand David Kaiser, the publication of the 1982 proof of the no-cloning theorem byWootters and Zurek and by Dieks was prompted by a proposal of Nick Herbert for a superluminal communication device using quantum entanglement, and Giancarlo Ghirardi had proven the theorem 18 months prior to the published proof by Wootters and Zurek in his referee report to said proposal (as evidenced by a letter from the editor).

Who showed that n qubits can carry more than n classical bits of information?,"In the acknowledgments of his 1995 paper, Schumacher states that the term qubit was created in jest during a conversation with William Wootters. ==Bit versus qubit== A binary digit, characterized as 0 or 1, is used to represent information in classical computers. However, a qubit can hold more information, e.g., up to two bits using superdense coding. * An introduction to qubits for non-specialists, by the person who coined the word, is found in Lecture 21 of The science of information: from language to black holes, by Professor Benjamin Schumacher, The Great Courses, The Teaching Company (4DVDs, 2015). Bennett's laws of quantum information are: # 1 qubit \geqslant 1 bit (classical), # 1 qubit \geqslant 1 ebit (entanglement bit), # 1 ebit + 1 qubit \geqslant 2 bits (i.e. superdense coding), # 1 ebit + 2 bits \geqslant 1 qubit (i.e. quantum teleportation), where \geqslant indicates ""can do the job of"".

The implementation of reversible computing thus amounts to learning how to characterize and control the physical dynamics of mechanisms to carry out desired computational operations so precisely that we can accumulate a negligible total amount of uncertainty regarding the complete physical state of the mechanism, per each logic operation that is performed.

What factors contribute to the residual errors in GPS measurements?,"The GPS makes corrections for receiver clock errors and other effects but there are still residual errors which are not corrected. Because SA affects every GPS receiver in a given area almost equally, a fixed station with an accurately known position can measure the SA error values and transmit them to the local GPS receivers so they may correct their position fixes. Correcting these errors is a significant challenge to improving GPS position accuracy. The change in the error in position relative to the GPS can be used to estimate the unknown angle error. For very precise positioning (e.g., in geodesy), these effects can be eliminated by differential GPS: the simultaneous use of two or more receivers at several survey points.

Which algebra are the dual quaternions isomorphic to?,"As an algebra over the real numbers, the algebra of split-quaternions is isomorphic to the algebra of 2×2 real matrices by the above defined isomorphism. First, dual quaternions are isomorphic to the Clifford algebra generated by 3 anticommuting elements i, j, e with i^2 = j^2 = -1 and e^2 = 0. Second, the dual quaternions are isomorphic to the even part of the Clifford algebra generated by 4 anticommuting elements e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4 with :e_1 ^2 = e_2^2 = e_3^2 = -1, \,\, e_4^2 = 0. thumb|right|Plaque on Broom bridge (Dublin) commemorating Hamilton's invention of quaternions In mathematics, the dual quaternions are an 8-dimensional real algebra isomorphic to the tensor product of the quaternions and the dual numbers.

Do dual quaternions form a division algebra?,"A quaternion algebra (a,b)F is either a division algebra or isomorphic to the matrix algebra of 2 × 2 matrices over F; the latter case is termed split.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.3 The norm form :N(t + xi +yj + zk) = t^2 - ax^2 - by^2 + abz^2 \ defines a structure of division algebra if and only if the norm is an anisotropic quadratic form, that is, zero only on the zero element. As an algebra over the real numbers, the algebra of split-quaternions is isomorphic to the algebra of 2×2 real matrices by the above defined isomorphism. In a similar way, over any local field F there are exactly two quaternion algebras: the 2 × 2 matrices over F and a division algebra. For example, over the p-adic numbers Hamilton's quaternions are a division algebra only when p is 2. This means that split-quaternions and 2×2 matrices form a composition algebra.",Yes,No,Sometimes,Not sure,Maybe,B,TRUE,"Dual quaternions are an extension of quaternions and are used to represent rigid transformations in 3D space. Dual quaternions are not a division algebra, but rather a composition algebra, which means that they do not have a unique division algorithm. Therefore, the answer is B) No."

Della Moneta (On Money) is a book written by Ferdinando Galiani, and is considered one of the first specific treatises on economics, especially monetary theory, preceding Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations by twenty-five years. ==Summary== Della Moneta is divided into five sections, covering what are still seen today as the standard aspects of monetary theory. Investors are willing to forgo spending their money now only if they expect a favorable net return on their investment in the future, such that the increased value to be available later is sufficiently high to offset both the preference to spending money now and inflation (if present); see required rate of return. ==History== The Talmud (~500 CE) recognizes the time value of money.",Martín de Azpilcueta,The School of Salamanca,Tractate Makkos,The false witnesses,The borrowers,C,TRUE,"The background knowledge mentions that the Talmud recognizes the time value of money in Tractate Makkos page 3a.

Why is directed motion difficult to achieve on the nanoscale?,"On the nanoscale (1-100 nm), viscosity dominates inertia, and the extremely high degree of thermal noise in the environment makes conventional directed motion all but impossible, because the forces impelling these motors in the desired direction are minuscule when compared to the random forces exerted by the environment.

The theory behind Brownian motors relies on the phenomenon of Brownian motion, random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas) resulting from their collision with the fast-moving molecules in the fluid. Because Brownian motors rely on the random nature of thermal noise to achieve directed motion, they are stochastic in nature, in that they can be analysed statistically but not predicted precisely. == Examples in nature == In biology, much of what we understand to be protein-based molecular motors may also in fact be Brownian motors.",They can explain protein synthesis and muscular contraction,They can generate electricity,They can be used in space exploration,They can control weather patterns,They can cure diseases,A,TRUE,"The background knowledge states that Brownian motors may have implications for the foundations of life itself, and can explain crucial cellular processes that require movement at the nanoscale, such as protein synthesis and muscular contraction.

First introduced by M. Pollak, the Coulomb gap is a soft gap in the single- particle density of states (DOS) of a system of interacting localized electrons.

From the American Association for the Advancement of Science: > A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of > the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly > confirmed through observation and experiment. A scientific theory is an explanation of an aspect of the natural world and universe that can be (or a fortiori, that has been) repeatedly tested and corroborated in accordance with the scientific method, using accepted protocols of observation, measurement, and evaluation of results. Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing technology or curing diseases. ===Definitions from scientific organizations=== The United States National Academy of Sciences defines scientific theories as follows: > The formal scientific definition of ""theory"" is quite different from the > everyday meaning of the word. In modern science, the term ""theory"" refers to scientific theories, a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with the scientific method, and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science.

What is formal linguistics?,"Formal linguistics is the branch of linguistics which uses applied mathematical methods for the analysis of natural languages. A formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, which consists of its formation rules.

Who proposed the use of formal grammars in linguistics?,"Building on the work of David Hilbert and Rudolf Carnap, Hjelmslev proposed the use of formal grammars to analyse, generate and explain language in his 1943 book Prolegomena to a Theory of Language. The formal description of language was further developed by linguists including J. R. Firth and Simon Dik, giving rise to modern grammatical frameworks such as systemic functional linguistics and functional discourse grammar.

What is the relationship between meaning and form in language according to formal linguistics?,"Nevertheless, there is often an expectation of a one- to-one relationship between meaning and form, and indeed, many traditional definitions are based on such an assumption. In linguistics, a form-meaning mismatch is a natural mismatch between the grammatical form and its expected meaning. Syntax has developed to describe how words relate to each other in order to form sentences. In the study of language, description or descriptive linguistics is the work of objectively analyzing and describing how language is actually used (or how it was used in the past) by a speech community.François & Ponsonnet (2013). Linguistic description as a discipline really took off at the end of the 19th century, with the Structuralist revolution (from Ferdinand de Saussure to Leonard Bloomfield), and the notion that every language forms a unique symbolic system, different from other languages, worthy of being described “in its own terms”. == Methods == The first critical step of language description is to collect data.",There is no relationship between meaning and form,Meaning and form are determined by cultural context,Meaning and form are determined by individual speakers,Meaning and form are determined by a mathematical relationship,Meaning and form are determined by historical evolution,D,FALSE,fail

What is entropic gravity?,"Entropic gravity, also known as emergent gravity, is a theory in modern physics that describes gravity as an entropic force—a force with macro-scale homogeneity but which is subject to quantum-level disorder—and not a fundamental interaction.

In his 1964 lecture on the Relation of Mathematics and Physics, Richard Feynman describes a related theory for gravity where the gravitational force is explained due to an entropic force due to unspecified microscopic degrees of freedom. Subsequently, other physicists, most notably Thanu Padmanabhan, began to explore links between gravity and entropy. ==Erik Verlinde's theory== In 2009, Erik Verlinde proposed a conceptual model that describes gravity as an entropic force. *Conformal gravity *Gravity as an entropic force, gravity arising as an emergent phenomenon from the thermodynamic concept of entropy.",A fundamental force in modern physics,A theory that describes gravity as an entropic force,A theory that describes gravity as a fundamental interaction,A principle in quantum mechanics,A principle in classical mechanics,B,TRUE,"The background knowledge provides a clear definition of entropic gravity as a theory that describes gravity as an entropic force, which is different from a fundamental interaction.

What does the theory of entropic gravity attribute to dark matter?,"The theory of entropic gravity posits that what has been interpreted as unobserved dark matter is the product of quantum effects that can be regarded as a form of positive dark energy that lifts the vacuum energy of space from its ground state value. Various astrophysical observationsincluding gravitational effects which cannot be explained by currently accepted theories of gravity unless more matter is present than can be seenimply dark matter's presence. In addition to continuing theoretical work in various directions, there are many experiments planned or in progress to actually detect or better determine the properties of dark matter (beyond its gravitational attraction), all of which would be undermined by an alternative explanation for the gravitational effects currently attributed to this elusive entity. ==Origin== The thermodynamic description of gravity has a history that goes back at least to research on black hole thermodynamics by Bekenstein and Hawking in the mid-1970s.

What is the definition of a natural product in the field of organic chemistry?,"Within the field of organic chemistry, the definition of natural products is usually restricted to organic compounds isolated from natural sources that are produced by the pathways of primary or secondary metabolism. A natural product is a natural compound or substance produced by a living organism—that is, found in nature. The term natural product has also been extended for commercial purposes to refer to cosmetics, dietary supplements, and foods produced from natural sources without added artificial ingredients. Although natural products have inspired numerous drugs, drug development from natural sources has received declining attention in the 21st century by pharmaceutical companies, partly due to unreliable access and supply, intellectual property, cost, and profit concerns, seasonal or environmental variability of composition, and loss of sources due to rising extinction rates. == Classes == The broadest definition of natural product is anything that is produced by life, and includes the likes of biotic materials (e.g. wood, silk), bio-based materials (e.g. bioplastics, cornstarch), bodily fluids (e.g. milk, plant exudates), and other natural materials (e.g. soil, coal).

Why have natural products played a central role in the development of organic chemistry?,"Natural products can also be prepared by chemical synthesis (both semisynthesis and total synthesis) and have played a central role in the development of the field of organic chemistry by providing challenging synthetic targets. In this regard, natural products play a central role in the training of new synthetic organic chemists, and are a principal motivation in the development of new variants of old chemical reactions (e.g., the Evans aldol reaction), as well as the discovery of completely new chemical reactions (e.g., the Woodward cis-hydroxylation, Sharpless epoxidation, and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions). == History == === Foundations of organic and natural product chemistry === The concept of natural products dates back to the early 19th century, when the foundations of organic chemistry were laid. In addition, natural products are prepared by organic synthesis, to provide confirmation of their structure, or to give access to larger quantities of natural products of interest. Because natural products are generally secondary metabolites with complex chemical structures, their total/semisynthesis is not always commercially viable.

What are secondary metabolites?,"Secondary metabolites, also called specialised metabolites, toxins, secondary products, or natural products, are organic compounds produced by any lifeform, e.g. bacteria, fungi, animals, or plants, which are not directly involved in the normal growth, development, or reproduction of the organism. Secondary metabolites are metabolic intermediates or products which are not essential to growth and life of the producing plants but rather required for interaction of plants with their environment and produced in response to stress. A secondary metabolite is typically present in a taxonomically restricted set of organisms or cells (plants, fungi, bacteria, etc.). Some common examples of secondary metabolites include: ergot alkaloids, antibiotics, naphthalenes, nucleosides, phenazines, quinolines, terpenoids, peptides and growth factors.

Today, municipal engineering may be confused with urban design or urban planning. Municipal or urban engineering applies the tools of science, art and engineering in an urban environment. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously (for a given street or development project), and managed by the same municipal authority. ==History== Modern municipal engineering finds its origins in the 19th-century United Kingdom, following the Industrial Revolution and the growth of large industrial cities.",Designing and constructing buildings,Managing public transportation systems,Maintaining urban infrastructure,Developing agricultural practices,Promoting environmental conservation,C,TRUE,"The background knowledge provides a clear definition of municipal engineering and its scope.

What is the basis of expected utility theory?,"The theory of subjective expected utility combines two concepts: first, a personal utility function, and second a personal probability distribution (usually based on Bayesian probability theory). This is demonstrated in the contrast of individual preferences under the insurance and lottery context shows the degree of indeterminacy of the expected utility theory. The expected utility maximizing individual makes decisions rationally based on the axioms of the theory. The rank-dependent expected utility model (originally called anticipated utility) is a generalized expected utility model of choice under uncertainty, designed to explain the behaviour observed in the Allais paradox, as well as for the observation that many people both purchase lottery tickets (implying risk-loving preferences) and insure against losses (implying risk aversion). Generalized expected utility is a decision-making metric based on any of a variety of theories that attempt to resolve some discrepancies between expected utility theory and empirical observations, concerning choice under risky (probabilistic) circumstances.

How can stagnation zones be used in mathematics?,"Quarterly of applied mathematics 43.2 (1985): 215–223.Wang, C. Y. ""Impinging stagnation flows."" The flow in the neighborhood of the stagnation point or line can generally be described using potential flow theory, although viscous effects cannot be neglected if the stagnation point lies on a solid surface. ==Stagnation point flow without solid surfaces== When two streams either of two-dimensional or axisymmetric nature impinge on each other orthogonally, a stagnation plane is created, where the incoming streams are diverted tangentially outwards; thus on the stagnation plane, the velocity component normal to that plane is zero, whereas the tangential component is non-zero. The flow near the stagnation point can by studied using self-similar solution. The initial study of impinging stagnation flows are due to C.Y. Wang.Wang, C. Y.

Over PAC fields there is a firm link between arithmetic properties of the field and group theoretic properties of its absolute Galois group. Any set of objects upon which all four arithmetic operations (except division by zero) can be performed, and where these four operations obey the usual laws (including distributivity), is called a field. ===Addition=== Addition, denoted by the symbol +, is the most basic operation of arithmetic.

The Ćuk converter (pronounced chook; sometimes incorrectly spelled Cuk, Čuk or Cúk) is a type of buck-boost converter with low ripple current. Additionally, the parasitic elements of the transformer, namely leakage inductance and magnetizing inductance can be used to modify the circuit into a resonant converter circuit which has much improved efficiency. ==Related structures== ===Inductor coupling=== Instead of using two discrete inductor components, many designers implement a coupled inductor Ćuk converter, using a single magnetic component that includes both inductors on the same core.

What is the goal of a formal ontology?,"In philosophy, the term formal ontology is used to refer to an ontology defined by axioms in a formal language with the goal to provide an unbiased (domain- and application-independent) view on reality, which can help the modeler of domain- or application-specific ontologies (information science) to avoid possibly erroneous ontological assumptions encountered in modeling large-scale ontologies. In information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. A formal ontology, on the other hand, represents entities without a particular application scope. As refinement of Gruber's definition Feilmayr and Wöß (2016) stated: ""An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity."" By maintaining an independent view on reality a formal (upper level) ontology gains the following properties: *indefinite expandability: *:the ontology remains consistent with increasing content. *content and context independence: *:any kind of 'concept' can find its place. *accommodate different levels of granularity. ==Historical background== Theories on how to conceptualize reality date back as far as Plato and Aristotle.",To provide a biased view on reality,To model large-scale ontologies,To avoid erroneous ontological assumptions,To expand the content of the ontology,To accommodate different levels of granularity,C,TRUE,"The background knowledge defines formal ontology as an ontology defined by axioms in a formal language with the goal to provide an unbiased view on reality, which can help the modeler of domain- or application-specific ontologies to avoid possibly erroneous ontological assumptions encountered in modeling large-scale ontologies.

What was the historical limitation of airspace?,"* The airspace around many Defence and Indian Air Force bases are restricted, although new proposals are suggesting opening them for civilian aircraft. Restricted airspace is an area of airspace typically used by the military in which the local controlling authorities have determined that air traffic must be restricted or prohibited for safety or security concerns. Violating prohibited airspace established for national security purposes may result in military interception and/or the possibility of an attack upon the violating aircraft, or if this is avoided then large fines and jail time are often incurred. A prohibited airspace is an area (volume) of airspace within which flight of aircraft is not allowed, usually due to security concerns. Notable ones include the Flight Restriction Zone (FRZ) encompassing all airspace up to within approximately of Ronald Reagan National Airport around Washington, D.C. Flights within this airspace, while not entirely prohibited, are highly restricted. ",Limited availability of military aircraft,Limited capacity for airmail services,Limited access to airspace for commercial purposes,Limited technology for air navigation,Limited funding for aviation research,C,TRUE,"The background knowledge provides information about restricted and prohibited airspace due to safety and security concerns.

Also, many mathematical theories, which had seemed to be totally pure mathematics, were eventually used in applied areas, mainly physics and computer science. Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts independently of any application outside mathematics. This led many mathematicians to focus on mathematics for its own sake, that is, pure mathematics. The case was made that pure mathematics is useful in engineering education:A. S.

Who conducted studies on emotion and movement in humans and animals?,"Evolution and natural selection has been applied to the study of human communication, mainly by Charles Darwin in his 1872 work, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Evolutionary psychologists consider human emotions to be best adapted to the life our ancestors led in nomadic foraging bands. ==Origins== Darwin's original plan was to include his findings about expression of emotions in a chapter of his work, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (Darwin, 1871) but found that he had enough material for a whole book. Victoria to Freud, 5 volumes, New York 1984-1998. \- the field converges methodologically with newer historiographical approaches such as conceptual history, historical constructivism and the history of the body.On the precursors of the history of the emotions see: Jan Plamper, Geschichte und Gefühl. More recently, the history of emotions has engaged with recent social and cultural turns in the neurosciences, positing the history of emotions as a component part of a broader biocultural historicism.Rob Boddice, The History of Emotions, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2018. ==Bibliography== ===Introductions=== * Rob Boddice, The History of Emotions, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2018.

What is the medium that holds the pigment in fresco technique?,"If the pigments are mixed with lime water or lime milk and applied to a dry plaster the technique is called lime secco painting. The additional a secco work would be done to make changes, and sometimes to add small details, but also because not all colours can be achieved in true fresco, because only some pigments work chemically in the very alkaline environment of fresh lime-based plaster. An indispensable component of this process is the carbonatation of the lime, which fixes the colour in the plaster ensuring durability of the fresco for future generations.How is a fresco made? This chemical reaction fixes the pigment particles at the plaster's surface in a protective crystalline mesh known as the lime crust.Fresco Painting: The Dichotomy of Rigorous Craft and Artistic Expression, Tessa Lindsey The advantage of buon fresco is its durability.

What is an oil spill?,"An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. Oil spills may be due to releases of crude oil from tankers, offshore platforms, drilling rigs and wells, as well as spills of refined petroleum products (such as gasoline and diesel fuel) and their by-products, heavier fuels used by large ships such as bunker fuel, or the spill of any oily refuse or waste oil. The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. Causes of oil spills are further distinguished between deliberate releases, such as operational discharges or acts of war and accidental releases. As a result, oil spill accidents have initiated intense media attention and political uproar, bringing many together in a political struggle concerning government response to oil spills and what actions can best prevent them from happening. ==Human impact== An oil spill represents an immediate negative effects on human health, including respiratory and reproductive problems as well as liver, and immune system damage.

Which ecosystem is most affected by oil spills?,"Such analysis can also be used to follow weathering and degradation of crude spills. ==Largest oil spills== Crude oil and refined fuel spills from tanker ship accidents have damaged vulnerable ecosystems in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, the Galapagos Islands, France, the Sundarbans, Ogoniland, and many other places. Oil tanker spills are considered a major ecological threat due to the large amount of oil spilled per accident and the fact that major sea traffic routes are close to Large Marine Ecosystems. There are varying types of coastal habitats and ecosystems and thus also many endangered species that need to be considered when looking at affected areas post oil spills. Oil spills, when they occur, are detrimental to the surrounding environment, humans, and native wildlife.

What are the consequences of oil spills on wildlife?,"Oil spills penetrate into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Oil penetrates into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing their insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Oil spills have a more drastic impact in the late winter and early spring months, because large populations of overwintering birds gather near shores. However, marine species are more likely to be impacted by an oil spill. === Birds === Of the many species affected by direct exposure to oil, birds are usually the most severely affected.

Birds are usually the most severely affected by direct exposure to oil. Therefore, option E can be eliminated. Option A is incorrect because oil spills reduce buoyancy in the water. Option B and C are also incorrect because oil spills reduce the insulating ability of plumage and fur, and increase vulnerability to temperature fluctuations. Option D is partially correct because oil spills can damage the liver and immune system of wildlife, but it is not the only consequence. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Damage to liver and immune system."
What factors affect the cleanup and recovery from an oil spill?,"Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved.
