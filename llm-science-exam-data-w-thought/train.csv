The observed distortions can be used to model the distribution of dark matter in the cluster. == Temperature and density == Clusters of galaxies are the most recent and most massive objects to have arisen in the hierarchical structure formation of the Universe and the study of clusters tells one about the way galaxies form and evolve. A 2021 article postulated that approximately 50% of all baryonic matter is outside dark matter haloes, filling the space between galaxies, and that this would explain the missing baryons not accounted for in the 2017 paper. == Current state == Currently, many groups have observed the intergalactic medium and circum-galactic medium to obtain more measurements and observations of baryons to support the leading observations. In cosmology, the missing baryon problem is an observed discrepancy between the amount of baryonic matter detected from shortly after the Big Bang and from more recent epochs.","MOND is a theory that reduces the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters by postulating the existence of a new form of matter called ""fuzzy dark matter.""",MOND is a theory that increases the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 20.,MOND is a theory that explains the missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters that was previously considered dark matter by demonstrating that the mass is in the form of neutrinos and axions.,MOND is a theory that reduces the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 2.,MOND is a theory that eliminates the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters by imposing a new mathematical formulation of gravity that does not require the existence of dark matter.,D,TRUE,"MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) is a theory that proposes a modification to Newtonian gravity to explain the observed discrepancies in the motion of galaxies without the need for dark matter. It does not postulate the existence of a new form of matter like 'fuzzy dark matter' or explain the missing baryonic mass as neutrinos and axions. Therefore, options A, C, and E can be eliminated. The correct answer is likely option D, which states that MOND reduces the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 2. However, we need to be cautious as the background knowledge does not explicitly mention the specific impact of MOND on the missing baryonic mass discrepancy in galaxy clusters. Further research may be required to confirm the accuracy of option D."
1,Which of the following is an accurate definition of dynamic scaling in self-similar systems?,"Many of these systems evolve in a self-similar fashion in the sense that data obtained from the snapshot at any fixed time is similar to the respective data taken from the snapshot of any earlier or later time. Many other seemingly disparate systems which are found to exhibit dynamic scaling.

3,What is the significance of regularization in terms of renormalization problems in physics?,"Renormalization is distinct from regularization, another technique to control infinities by assuming the existence of new unknown physics at new scales. == Self-interactions in classical physics == thumbnail|upright=1.3|Figure 1. Regularization is the first step towards obtaining a completely finite and meaningful result; in quantum field theory it must be usually followed by a related, but independent technique called renormalization. Rather than the existence of unknown new physics, assuming the existence of particle interactions with other surrounding particles in the environment, renormalization offers an alternatively strategy to resolve infinities in such classical problems. ==Specific types== Specific types of regularization procedures include *Dimensional regularization *Pauli–Villars regularization *Lattice regularization *Zeta function regularization *Causal regularizationScharf, G.: Finite Quantum Electrodynamics: The Causal Approach, Springer 1995. In physics, especially quantum field theory, regularization is a method of modifying observables which have singularities in order to make them finite by the introduction of a suitable parameter called the regulator. Similar regularization arguments work in other renormalization problems.","Regularizing the mass-energy of an electron with a finite radius can theoretically simplify calculations involving infinities or singularities, thereby providing explanations that would otherwise be impossible to achieve.",Regularizing the mass-energy of an electron with an infinite radius allows for the breakdown of a theory that is valid under one set of conditions.

4,Which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between the dimensions of a diffracting object and the angular spacing of features in the diffraction pattern?,"Several qualitative observations can be made of diffraction in general: * The angular spacing of the features in the diffraction pattern is inversely proportional to the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. In other words: The smaller the diffracting object, the 'wider' the resulting diffraction pattern, and vice versa. * The diffraction angles are invariant under scaling; that is, they depend only on the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the diffracting object.

Under these circumstances, Gauss's law modifies to \Phi_E = \frac{Q_\mathrm{free}}{\varepsilon} for the integral form, and abla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{free}}{\varepsilon} for the differential form. ==Interpretations== ===In terms of fields of force=== Gauss's theorem can be interpreted in terms of the lines of force of the field as follows: The flux through a closed surface is dependent upon both the magnitude and direction of the electric field lines penetrating the surface.

8,What is the term used in astrophysics to describe light-matter interactions resulting in energy shifts in the radiation field?,"While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as ""redshifts"" and ""blueshifts"", in astrophysics light-matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as ""reddening"" rather than ""redshifting"" which, as a term, is normally reserved for the effects discussed above. In physics, a redshift is an increase in the wavelength, and corresponding decrease in the frequency and photon energy, of electromagnetic radiation (such as light). The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and simultaneous increase in frequency and energy, is known as a negative redshift, or blueshift. For example, Doppler effect blueshifts () are associated with objects approaching (moving closer to) the observer with the light shifting to greater energies. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of the line of sight. ==Blueshift== The opposite of a redshift is a blueshift.

11,What is the relationship between the Wigner function and the density matrix operator?,"Most importantly, the Wigner quasi-probability distribution is the Wigner transform of the quantum density matrix, and, conversely, the density matrix is the Weyl transform of the Wigner function. :Note: the Wigner distribution function is abbreviated here as WD rather than WDF as used at Wigner distribution function A Modified Wigner distribution function is a variation of the Wigner distribution function (WD) with reduced or removed cross-terms. The original WD, the spectrogram, and the modified WDs all belong to the Cohen's class of bilinear time-frequency representations : :C_x(t, f)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}W_x(\theta, u) \Pi(t - \theta,f - u)\, d\theta\, d u \quad = [W_x\,\ast\,\Pi] (t,f) where \Pi \left(t, f\right) is Cohen's kernel function, which is often a low-pass function, and normally serves to mask out the interference in the original Wigner representation. == Mathematical definition == *Wigner distribution : W_x(t,f) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t+\tau/2) x^*(t-\tau/2) e^{-j2\pi\tau f} \, d\tau Cohen's kernel function : \Pi (t,f) = \delta_{(0,0)} (t,f) *Spectrogram :SP_x (t,f) = |ST_x (t,f)|^2 = ST_x (t,f)\,ST_x^* (t,f) where ST_x is the short-time Fourier transform of x.

12,What is one of the examples of the models proposed by cosmologists and theoretical physicists without the cosmological or Copernican principles that can be used to address specific issues in the Lambda-CDM model and distinguish between current models and other possible models?,"The current standard model of cosmology is the Lambda-CDM model, wherein the Universe is governed by general relativity, began with a Big Bang and today is a nearly-flat universe that consists of approximately 5% baryons, 27% cold dark matter, and 68% dark energy.See the Planck Collaboration's 2015 data release. The standard cosmological model is known as the Lambda-CDM model. ===Equations of motion=== Within the standard cosmological model, the equations of motion governing the universe as a whole are derived from general relativity with a small, positive cosmological constant. The effect on cosmology of the dark energy that these models describe is given by the dark energy's equation of state, which varies depending upon the theory. These proposals typically modify some of the main features of Lambda-CDM, but do not reject the Big Bang. ===Anisotropic universe=== Isotropicity – the idea that the universe looks the same in all directions – is one of the core assumptions that enters into the Friedmann equations. However, the final announcement (in April 1992) of COBE satellite data corrected the earlier contradiction of the Big Bang; the popularity of plasma cosmology has since fallen. == Alternatives and extensions to Lambda-CDM == The standard model of cosmology today, the Lambda-CDM model, has been extremely successful at providing a theoretical framework for structure formation, the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, and the accelerating expansion of the universe.","The Copernican principle, which proposes that Earth, the Solar System, and the Milky Way are not at the centre of the universe, but instead, the universe is expanding equally in all directions.

13,What is the Roche limit?,"In celestial mechanics, the Roche limit, also called Roche radius, is the distance from a celestial body within which a second celestial body, held together only by its own force of gravity, will disintegrate because the first body's tidal forces exceed the second body's self-gravitation. But note that, as defined above, the Roche limit refers to a body held together solely by the gravitational forces which cause otherwise unconnected particles to coalesce, thus forming the body in question. The Roche limit for a rigid spherical satellite is the distance, d, from the primary at which the gravitational force on a test mass at the surface of the object is exactly equal to the tidal force pulling the mass away from the object:see calculation in Frank H. Shu, The Physical Universe: an Introduction to Astronomy, p. 431, University Science Books (1982), . : d = R_M\left(2 \frac {\rho_M} {\rho_m} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} where R_M is the radius of the primary, \rho_M is the density of the primary, and \rho_m is the density of the satellite. The Roche limit is also usually calculated for the case of a circular orbit, although it is straightforward to modify the calculation to apply to the case (for example) of a body passing the primary on a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory. === Rigid satellites === The rigid-body Roche limit is a simplified calculation for a spherical satellite. Since, within the Roche limit, tidal forces overwhelm the gravitational forces that might otherwise hold the satellite together, no satellite can gravitationally coalesce out of smaller particles within that limit.",The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to rotate since the forces exerted by two massive bodies produce a torque on a third object.,The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to unite since differential force from a planet results in parts becoming attracted to one another.,The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause a planet to disintegrate since differential force from an object overcomes the planet's core.,The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to disintegrate since differential force from a planet overcomes the attraction of the parts between them.,"The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to break apart due to differential force from the planet overcoming the attraction of the parts of the object for one another, which depends on the object's density and composition, as well as the mass and size of the planet.",D,FALSE,fail
14,What is Martin Heidegger's view on the relationship between time and human existence?,"===Time=== Heidegger believes that time finds its meaning in death, according to Michael Kelley.

15,"What is the ""ultraviolet catastrophe""?","The ultraviolet catastrophe, also called the Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe, was the prediction of late 19th century/early 20th century classical physics that an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium would emit an unbounded quantity of energy as wavelength decreased into the ultraviolet range.The term ""ultraviolet catastrophe"" was first used in 1911 by Paul Ehrenfest, but the concept originated with the 1900 statistical derivation of the Rayleigh–Jeans law. The ""ultraviolet catastrophe"" is the expression of the fact that the formula misbehaves at higher frequencies, i.e. B_{ u}(T) \to \infty as u \to \infty. Ultraviolet is a novelization of the science fiction film of the same name. Ultraviolet astronomy is the observation of electromagnetic radiation at ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 10 and 320 nanometres; shorter wavelengths--higher energy photons--are studied by X-ray astronomy and gamma- ray astronomy.

16,What is the most popular explanation for the shower-curtain effect?,"However, the shower-curtain effect persists when cold water is used, implying that this cannot be the only mechanism at work. ===Bernoulli effect hypothesis === The most popular explanation given for the shower-curtain effect is Bernoulli's principle. The shower-curtain effect in physics describes the phenomenon of a shower curtain being blown inward when a shower is running. If air is moving across the inside surface of the shower curtain, Bernoulli's principle says the air pressure there will drop. In a steady state the steam will be replaced by new steam delivered by the shower but in reality the water temperature will fluctuate and lead to times when the net steam production is negative. ===Air pressure=== Colder dense air outside and hot less dense air inside causes higher air pressure on the outside to force the shower curtain inwards to equalise the air pressure, this can be observed simply when the bathroom door is open allowing cold air into the bathroom. ==Solutions== Many shower curtains come with features to reduce the shower-curtain effect. By pushing the curtain in towards the shower, the (short range) vortex and Coandă effects become more significant.

17,What is the butterfly effect?,"The butterfly effect describes a phenomenon in chaos theory whereby a minor change in circumstances can cause a large change in outcome. In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or velocity of an object in a given Hamiltonian system, the quantum butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the Hamiltonian system with a given initial position and velocity. He noted that the butterfly effect is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several weeks earlier. The butterfly effect concept has since been used outside the context of weather science as a broad term for any situation where a small change is supposed to be the cause of larger consequences. ==History== In The Vocation of Man (1800), Johann Gottlieb Fichte says ""you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole"".","The butterfly effect is a physical cause that occurs when a massive sphere is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium, and its velocity is assumed to be caused by the force of gravity accelerating it.",The butterfly effect is a distributed causality that opens up the opportunity to understand the relationship between necessary and sufficient conditions in classical (Newtonian) physics.,The butterfly effect is a proportionality between the cause and the effect of a physical phenomenon in classical (Newtonian) physics.,The butterfly effect is a small push that is needed to set a massive sphere into motion when it is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium.,The butterfly effect is a phenomenon that highlights the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a more general use of causality as represented by Mackie's INUS conditions.,E,TRUE,"The background knowledge provided explains the concept of the butterfly effect in chaos theory.

The term ""spontaneous symmetry breaking"" is a misnomer here as Elitzur's theorem states that local gauge symmetries can never be spontaneously broken. When a theory is symmetric with respect to a symmetry group, but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry. ==Overview== By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of physical laws (e.g. quantum mechanics) which are invariant under a symmetry transformation (such as translation or rotation), so that any pair of outcomes differing only by that transformation have the same probability distribution. If there is a field (often a background field) which acquires an expectation value (not necessarily a vacuum expectation value) which is not invariant under the symmetry in question, we say that the system is in the ordered phase, and the symmetry is spontaneously broken.

79,What is a Hilbert space in quantum mechanics?,"In quantum mechanics, the Hilbert space is the space of complex-valued functions belonging to L^2 (\mathbb{R}^3 , d^3x), where the simple \mathbb{R}^3 is the classical configuration space of free particle which has finite degrees of freedom, and d^3 x is the Lebesgue measure on \mathbb{R}^3. Phase-space representation of quantum state vectors is a formulation of quantum mechanics elaborating the phase-space formulation with a Hilbert space. For this purpose, the Hilbert space of a quantum system is enlarged by introducing an auxiliary quantum system. In quantum field theory, it is expected that the Hilbert space is also the L^2 space on the configuration space of the field, which is infinite dimensional, with respect to some Borel measure naturally defined.

A so-called grey body is a body for which the spectral emissivity is independent of wavelength, so that the total emissivity, \varepsilon, is a constant. For an ideal absorber/emitter or black body, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time (also known as the radiant exitance) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's temperature, T: : M^{\circ} = \sigma\, T^{4}.

82,What is the reason for the formation of stars exclusively within molecular clouds?,"This is a natural consequence of their low temperatures and high densities, because the gravitational force acting to collapse the cloud must exceed the internal pressures that are acting ""outward"" to prevent a collapse. There is observed evidence that the large, star-forming clouds are confined to a large degree by their own gravity (like stars, planets, and galaxies) rather than by external pressure. The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well- supported by observation, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds. In triggered star formation, one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its gravitational collapse. A molecular cloud, sometimes called a stellar nursery (if star formation is occurring within), is a type of interstellar cloud, the density and size of which permit absorption nebulae, the formation of molecules (most commonly molecular hydrogen, H2), and the formation of H II regions.",The formation of stars occurs exclusively outside of molecular clouds.,"The low temperatures and high densities of molecular clouds cause the gravitational force to exceed the internal pressures that are acting ""outward"" to prevent a collapse.","The low temperatures and low densities of molecular clouds cause the gravitational force to be less than the internal pressures that are acting ""outward"" to prevent a collapse.","The high temperatures and low densities of molecular clouds cause the gravitational force to exceed the internal pressures that are acting ""outward"" to prevent a collapse.","The high temperatures and high densities of molecular clouds cause the gravitational force to be less than the internal pressures that are acting ""outward"" to prevent a collapse.",B,TRUE,"The background knowledge states that the formation of stars occurs within molecular clouds.

85,What is the reason behind the largest externally observed electrical effects when two conductors are separated by the smallest distance without touching?,"In electromagnetics, proximity effect is a redistribution of electric current occurring in nearby parallel electrical conductors carrying alternating current flowing in the same direction which causes the current distribution in the conductor to concentrate on the side away from the nearby conductor.

The result is that the current is concentrated in the areas of the conductor farthest away from nearby conductors carrying current in the same direction.

Radiosity is often called in branches of physics other than radiometry, but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity. ==Mathematical definitions== ===Radiosity=== Radiosity of a surface, denoted Je (""e"" for ""energetic"", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as :J_\mathrm{e} = \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial A} = J_\mathrm{e,em} + J_\mathrm{e,r} + J_\mathrm{e,tr}, where * ∂ is the partial derivative symbol * \Phi_e is the radiant flux leaving (emitted, reflected and transmitted) * A is the area * J_{e,em} = M_e is the emitted component of the radiosity of the surface, that is to say its exitance * J_{e,r} is the reflected component of the radiosity of the surface * J_{e,tr} is the transmitted component of the radiosity of the surface For an opaque surface, the transmitted component of radiosity Je,tr vanishes and only two components remain: :J_\mathrm{e} = M_\mathrm{e} + J_\mathrm{e,r}. Radiodensity (or radiopacity) is opacity to the radio wave and X-ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum: that is, the relative inability of those kinds of electromagnetic radiation to pass through a particular material.

100,What is a virtual particle?,"Virtual photons are referred to as ""virtual"" because they do not exist as free particles in the traditional sense but instead serve as intermediate particles in the exchange of force between other particles. Virtual photons are said to be ""off-shell"", which means that they do not obey the usual relationship between energy and momentum that applies to real particles. In particle physics, V was a generic name for heavy, unstable subatomic particles that decay into a pair of particles, thereby producing a characteristic letter V in a bubble chamber or other particle detector. Virtual photons are a fundamental concept in particle physics and quantum field theory that play a crucial role in describing the interactions between electrically charged particles. Virtual photons are thought of as fluctuations in the electromagnetic field, characterized by their energy, momentum, and polarization.

152,What is the relationship between chemical potential and quarks/antiquarks?,"Most physicists simply refer to ""the number of bottom quarks"" and ""the number of bottom antiquarks"". ==Further reading== * Category:Quarks Category:Flavour (particle physics) Likewise, the potential has been extended to include spin-dependent terms ==Calculation of the quark-quark potential== A test of validity for approaches that seek to explain color confinement is that they must produce, in the limit that quark motions are non-relativistic, a potential that agrees with the Cornell potential. Up, charm and top quarks have an electric charge of +⅔, while the down, strange, and bottom quarks have an electric charge of −⅓. The strong interactions binding the quarks together are insensitive to these quantum numbers, so variation of them leads to systematic mass and coupling relationships among the hadrons in the same flavor multiplet. In physics, bottomness (symbol B′ using a prime as plain B is used already for baryon number) or beauty is a flavour quantum number reflecting the difference between the number of bottom antiquarks (n) and the number of bottom quarks (n) that are present in a particle: : B^\prime = -(n_b - n_{\bar b}) Bottom quarks have (by convention) a bottomness of −1 while bottom antiquarks have a bottomness of +1.","Chemical potential, represented by μ, is a measure of the imbalance between quarks and antiquarks in a system.

The American Petroleum Institute gravity, or API gravity, is a measure of how heavy or light a petroleum liquid is compared to water: if its API gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water; if less than 10, it is heavier and sinks. API has entered petroleum industry nomenclature in a number of areas: * API gravity, a measure of the density of petroleum. API gravity is graduated in degrees on a hydrometer instrument.

155,What is the significance of the redshift-distance relationship in determining the expansion history of the universe?,"The theory of relativity predicts phenomena associated with the expansion, notably the redshift-versus-distance relationship known as Hubble's Law; functional forms for cosmological distance measurements that differ from what would be expected if space were not expanding; and an observable change in the matter and energy density of the universe seen at different lookback times. Hubble's contribution was to show that the magnitude of the redshift correlated strongly with the distance to the galaxies. To determine the distance of distant objects, astronomers generally measure luminosity of standard candles, or the redshift factor 'z' of distant galaxies, and then convert these measurements into distances based on some particular model of spacetime, such as the Lambda-CDM model. However, galaxies lying farther away from this will recede away at ever-increasing speed and be redshifted out of our range of visibility. ===Metric expansion and speed of light=== At the end of the early universe's inflationary period, all the matter and energy in the universe was set on an inertial trajectory consistent with the equivalence principle and Einstein's general theory of relativity and this is when the precise and regular form of the universe's expansion had its origin (that is, matter in the universe is separating because it was separating in the past due to the inflaton field). Redshift is directly observable and used by cosmologists as a direct measure of lookback time.

Metals have non-zero density of states at the Fermi level. Metals with free-electron-like band structures (e.g. alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Cu, and Al) generally exhibit relatively low density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore exhibit fairly low electronic entropies. Electronic entropy is thus most relevant for the thermodynamics of condensed phases, where the density of states at the Fermi level can be quite large, and the electronic entropy can thus contribute substantially to thermodynamic behavior. Several other approximations can be made, but they all indicate that the electronic entropy should, to first order, be proportional to the temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level.

Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts () are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. Popular literature often uses the expression ""Doppler redshift"" instead of ""cosmological redshift"" to describe the redshift of galaxies dominated by the expansion of spacetime, but the cosmological redshift is not found using the relativistic Doppler equationOdenwald & Fienberg 1993 which is instead characterized by special relativity; thus is impossible while, in contrast, is possible for cosmological redshifts because the space which separates the objects (for example, a quasar from the Earth) can expand faster than the speed of light.Speed faster than light is allowed because the expansion of the spacetime metric is described by general relativity in terms of sequences of only locally valid inertial frames as opposed to a global Minkowski metric.","Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the rate of change of a(t) at the times of emission or absorption, while Doppler redshift depends on the increase of a(t) in the whole period from emission to absorption.","Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the local velocity of the object emitting the light, while Doppler redshift depends on the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe.",There is no difference between redshift due to the expansion of the universe and Doppler redshift.,"Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe, while Doppler redshift depends on the local velocity of the object emitting the light.","Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the increase of a(t) in the whole period from emission to absorption, while Doppler redshift depends on the rate of change of a(t) at the times of emission or absorption.",D,TRUE,"The background knowledge provides a clear distinction between redshift due to the expansion of the universe and Doppler redshift.

188,What is the relationship between the complete electromagnetic Hamiltonian of a molecule and the parity operation?,"Wiley To see that the parity's eigenvalues are phase factors, we assume an eigenstate of the parity operation (this is realized because the intrinsic parity is a property of a particle species) and use the fact that two parity transformations leave the particle in the same state, thus the new wave function can differ by only a phase factor, i.e.: P^{2} \psi = e^{i \phi} \psi thus P \psi = \pm e^{i \phi /2} \psi, since these are the only eigenstates satisfying the above equation. In quantum mechanics, the intrinsic parity is a phase factor that arises as an eigenvalue of the parity operation x_i \rightarrow x_i' = -x_i (a reflection about the origin).Griffiths, D., (1987).

Throttling can be used to actively limit a user's upload and download rates on programs such as video streaming, BitTorrent protocols and other file sharing applications, as well as even out the usage of the total bandwidth supplied across all users on the network. ","The throttling process is a steady flow of a fluid through a flow resistance, such as a valve or porous plug, and is responsible for the pressure increase in domestic refrigerators. This process is important because it is at the heart of the refrigeration cycle.","The throttling process is a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance, such as a valve or porous plug, and is responsible for the temperature drop in domestic refrigerators.

This process is not important because it is not used in the refrigeration cycle.",B,TRUE,"Based on the background knowledge provided, the throttling process refers to a steady flow of a fluid through a flow resistance, such as a valve or porous plug. It is responsible for either a pressure drop or a temperature drop, depending on the specific application. In the context of domestic refrigerators, the throttling process is important because it is at the heart of the refrigeration cycle, where it facilitates the temperature drop necessary for cooling. Therefore, the correct answer is option B) The throttling process is a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance, such as a valve or porous plug, and is responsible for the temperature drop in domestic refrigerators. This process is important because it is at the heart of the refrigeration cycle."
197,What happens to excess base metal as a solution cools from the upper transformation temperature towards an insoluble state?,"Furthermore, this melting may begin at a temperature below the equilibrium solidus temperature of the alloy. Recalescence also occurs after supercooling, when the supercooled liquid suddenly crystallizes, forming a solid but releasing heat in the process. ==See also== * Allotropy * Phase transition * Thermal analysis ==References== Category:Metallurgy Category:Phase transitions Category:Thermodynamic properties During this process, atomic diffusion occurs, which produces compositionally homogeneous grains. Unlike hot working, cold working causes the crystal grains and inclusions to distort following the flow of the metal; which may cause work hardening and anisotropic material properties. As a casting having a cored structure is reheated, grain boundary regions will melt first in as much as they are richer in the low-melting component. ","The excess base metal will often solidify, becoming the proeutectoid until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.","The excess base metal will often crystallize-out, becoming the proeutectoid until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.","The excess base metal will often dissolve, becoming the proeutectoid until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.","The excess base metal will often liquefy, becoming the proeutectoid until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.","The excess base metal will often evaporate, becoming the proeutectoid until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.",B,FALSE,fail
198,"What is the relationship between mass, force, and acceleration, according to Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?","Newton first set out the definition of mass This was then used to define the ""quantity of motion"" (today called momentum), and the principle of inertia in which mass replaces the previous Cartesian notion of intrinsic force. Newtonian refers to the work of Isaac Newton, in particular: * Newtonian mechanics, i.e. classical mechanics * Newtonian telescope, a type of reflecting telescope * Newtonian cosmology * Newtonian dynamics * Newtonianism, the philosophical principle of applying Newton's methods in a variety of fields * Newtonian fluid, a fluid that flows like water--its shear stress is linearly proportional to the velocity gradient in the direction perpendicular to the plane of shear ** Non-Newtonian fluids, in which the viscosity changes with the applied shear force ==Supplementary material== * List of things named after Isaac Newton (English: The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) often referred to as simply the (), is a book by Isaac Newton that expounds Newton's laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. Just as Newton examined consequences of different conceivable laws of attraction in Book 1, here he examines different conceivable laws of resistance; thus Section 1 discusses resistance in direct proportion to velocity, and Section 2 goes on to examine the implications of resistance in proportion to the square of velocity. In his notes, Newton wrote that the inverse square law arose naturally due to the structure of matter.","Mass is a property that determines the weight of an object. According to Newton's laws of motion and the formula F = ma, an object with a mass of one kilogram accelerates at one meter per second per second when acted upon by a force of one newton.","Mass is an inertial property that determines an object's tendency to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force.

199,What did Arthur Eddington discover about two of Einstein's types of gravitational waves?,"Eddington's criticism seems to have been based partly on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars, but to have ""raised irrelevant objections"" in addition, as Thanu Padmanabhan puts it. ==Relativity== During World War I, Eddington was secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from Willem de Sitter regarding Einstein's theory of general relativity. On 3 June, despite the clouds that had reduced the quality of the plates, Eddington recorded in his notebook: ""... one plate I measured gave a result agreeing with Einstein."" It contained the following quatrain: During the 1920s and 30s, Eddington gave numerous lectures, interviews, and radio broadcasts on relativity, in addition to his textbook The Mathematical Theory of Relativity, and later, quantum mechanics. It was named for the noted astronomer Arthur Eddington, who formulated much of the modern theory of stellar atmospheres and stellar structure, popularized Albert Einstein's work in the English language, carried out the first test (gravitational lensing) of the general theory of relativity, and made original contributions to the theory. It is notable that while the Eddington results were seen as a confirmation of Einstein's prediction, and in that capacity soon found their way into general relativity text books,Notably and Ch. 7 in among observers followed a decade-long discussion of the quantitative values of light deflection, with the precise results in contention even after several expeditions had repeated Eddington's observations on the occasion of subsequent eclipses.","Arthur Eddington showed that two of Einstein's types of waves were artifacts of the coordinate system he used, and could only be made to propagate at the speed of gravity by choosing appropriate coordinates.","Arthur Eddington showed that two of Einstein's types of waves were artifacts of the coordinate system he used, and could only be made to propagate at the speed of sound by choosing appropriate coordinates.","Arthur Eddington showed that two of Einstein's types of waves were artifacts of the coordinate system he used, and could be made to propagate at any speed by choosing appropriate coordinates.","Arthur Eddington showed that two of Einstein's types of waves were artifacts of the coordinate system he used, and could not be made to propagate at any speed by choosing appropriate coordinates.","Arthur Eddington showed that two of Einstein's types of waves were artifacts of the coordinate system he used, and could only be made to propagate at the speed of light by choosing appropriate coordinates.",C,FALSE,fail
