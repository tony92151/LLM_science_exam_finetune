What can be inferred from the Wikipedia excerpt regarding the authorship of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles?,"Because of their common authorship, the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles are often jointly referred to simply as Luke-Acts.

How can applied epistemology be defined based on the provided Wikipedia excerpt?,"Applied epistemology refers to the study that determines whether the systems of investigation that seek the truth lead to true beliefs about the world. Once applied epistemology is described as a method in an epistemological search, it implies that the methodology is supported by an epistemological foundation. == Background == Applied epistemology forms part of the concept of ""applied philosophy"" as theorists begin to distinguish it from ""applied ethics"". A proposed analogy to distinguish applied epistemology from epistemology holds that it involves the general opposition between theory and application. It is considered an applied epistemology due to the characterization that it is precise, formal, and normative. Applied epistemology emerged out of epistemologists routine examinations that determine whether truth-seeking practices like science and mathematics are capable of delivering truths.

What is the distinguishing feature of Mesopropithecus among sloth lemurs?,"However, as it had the shortest forelimbs of all sloth lemurs, it is thought that Mesopropithecus was more quadrupedal and did not use suspension as much as the other sloth lemurs.

What was the primary intention behind the use of the double A-side format by Boney M. for their singles?,"By the mid-1970s, it was used to refer to 12"" vinyl singles with three or four tracks (or an extended or remixed version of the lead single/song) on the A-side, with an additional two or three tracks on the B-side; the B-side was initially used by DJs. The term came into wide use in the 1970s, where it usually referred to 7-inch vinyl singles featuring one track on the A-side and two on the B-side. From early 2003, a format described as a ""Maxi-CD"" was reintroduced, alongside a new two-track CD single with a lower retail price. While Maxi-CDs had been much loved among the dance community, as most if not all of the remixes that had been commissioned by the label could be released commercially, lobbying by artists in other genres who felt obliged to record extra and cover tracks to provide enough material for their single releases was responsible for the rule change. This was packaged in a 12"" × 3"" cassette maxi single longbox (with a regular cardboard slipcase/cassette inside), although most later maxi singles were just issued in regular style cassette cases. ==CD maxi singles== When CDs began to appear as a popular single format in the early 1990s (see CD single), songs were occasionally released in two CD formats simultaneously, 3"" and 5"", predominantly as a marketing ploy but potentially as a logical extension of the 7"" and 12"" vinyl record formats to CD, with the 5"" CD sometimes marketed as a ""maxi-single"", most commonly in the US, and European countries (outside of the UK).",The double A-side format was used to have one song intended for radio and another specifically targeted at discos.,The double A-side format was used to increase the chances of chart success by releasing multiple songs simultaneously.,"The double A-side format was used to maximize the length of the single by including two songs, providing more value to the consumer.",The double A-side format was used to showcase the versatility of their musical style by featuring contrasting songs on the same release.,The double A-side format was used to showcase rarely performed songs that were featured only on promotional releases.,A,TRUE,"The double A-side format was initially used by DJs and later became popular for 7-inch vinyl singles with one track on the A-side and two on the B-side. Considering this, option A) The double A-side format was used to have one song intended for radio and another specifically targeted at discos seems like a plausible intention behind the use of the double A-side format by Boney M. for their singles."

What is the anabolic:androgenic ratio of Methoxydienone relative to testosterone propionate and nandrolone?,"The drug is a potent anabolic when administered via injection with an anabolic:androgenic ratio of approximately 54:27 relative to testosterone propionate and 90:625 relative to nandrolone.

The combination of nandrolone with a 5α-reductase inhibitor like finasteride or dutasteride will block the conversion of nandrolone into 5α-DHN and, unlike with testosterone and various other AAS, thereby considerably increase the propensity of nandrolone for producing androgenic side effects. ==See also== * 19-Norandrosterone * 19-Noretiocholanolone * 5α-Dihydronorethandrolone * 5α-Dihydronorethisterone * 5α-Dihydrolevonorgestrel * 5α-Dihydroethisterone ==References== Category:5α-Reduced steroid metabolites Category:Cyclopentanols Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Estranes Category:Human drug metabolites Category:Ketones MOHN is the 4-hydroxylated derivative of normethandrone (17α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), the 17α-methylated derivative of oxabolone (4-hydroxy-19-nortestosterone), the 4-hydroxylated and 17α-methylated derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), and the 19-demethylated analogue of oxymesterone (4-hydroxy-17α-methyltestosterone). ==See also== * List of androgens/anabolic steroids ==References== ==External links== * 4-Estren-17α-methyl-4,17β-diol-3-one - Steraloids Category:Enols Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Estranes Category:Hepatotoxins Category:Enones Category:World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited substances",Approximately 90:625 relative to testosterone propionate and 54:27 relative to nandrolone.,Approximately 27:54 relative to testosterone propionate and 625:90 relative to nandrolone.,Approximately 54:27 relative to nandrolone and 90:625 relative to testosterone propionate.,Approximately 27:54 relative to nandrolone and 625:90 relative to testosterone propionate.,Approximately 54:27 relative to testosterone propionate and 90:625 relative to nandrolone.,E,FALSE,fail
